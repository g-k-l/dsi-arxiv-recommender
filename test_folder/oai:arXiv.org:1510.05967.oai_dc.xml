 <dc:description>  We report on a "source-sink" algorithm which allows one to calculate
time-resolved physical quantities from a general nanoelectronic quantum system
(described by an arbitrary time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian) connected to
infinite electrodes. Although mathematically equivalent to the non equilibrium
Green's function formalism, the approach is based on the scattering wave
functions of the system. It amounts to solving a set of generalized
Schr\"odinger equations which include an additional "source" term (coming from
the time dependent perturbation) and an absorbing "sink" term (the electrodes).
The algorithm execution time scales linearly with both system size and
simulation time allowing one to simulate large systems (currently around $10^6$
degrees of freedom) and/or large times (currently around $10^5$ times the
smallest time scale of the system). As an application we calculate the
current-voltage characteristics of a Josephson junction for both short and long
junctions, and recover the multiple Andreev reflexion (MAR) physics. We also
discuss two intrinsically time-dependent situations: the relaxation time of a
Josephson junction after a quench of the voltage bias, and the propagation of
voltage pulses through a Josephson junction. In the case of a ballistic, long
Josephson junction, we predict that a fast voltage pulse creates an oscillatory
current whose frequency is controlled by the Thouless energy of the normal
part. A similar effect is found for short junctions, a voltage pulse produces
an oscillating current which, in the absence of electromagnetic environment,
does not relax.
