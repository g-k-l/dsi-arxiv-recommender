 <dc:description>  We study the competition of spin- and charge-density waves and their quantum
multicritical behavior for the semimetal-insulator transitions of
low-dimensional Dirac fermions. Employing the effective Gross-Neveu-Yukawa
theory with two order parameters as a model for graphene and a growing number
of other two-dimensional Dirac materials allows us to describe the physics near
the multicritical point at which the semimetallic and the spin- and
charge-density-wave phases meet. With the help of a functional renormalization
group approach, we are able to reveal a complex structure of fixed points, the
stability properties of which decisively depend on the number of Dirac fermions
$N_f$. We give estimates for the critical exponents and observe crucial
quantitative corrections as compared to the previous first-order $\epsilon$
expansion. For small $N_f$, the universal behavior near the multicritical point
is determined by the chiral Heisenberg universality class supplemented by a
decoupled, purely bosonic, Ising sector. At large $N_f$, a novel fixed point
with nontrivial couplings between all sectors becomes stable. At intermediate
$N_f$, including the graphene case ($N_f = 2$) no stable and physically
admissible fixed point exists. Graphene's phase diagram in the vicinity of the
intersection between the semimetal, antiferromagnetic and staggered density
phases should consequently be governed by a triple point exhibiting first-order
transitions.
