 <dc:description>  Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is a crucial signal processing procedure to
identify the underlying materials (or endmembers) and their corresponding
proportions (or abundances) from an observed hyperspectral scene. A well-known
blind HU criterion, advocated by Craig in early 1990's, considers the vertices
of the minimum-volume enclosing simplex of the data cloud as good endmember
estimates, and it has been empirically and theoretically found effective even
in the scenario of no pure pixels. However, such kind of algorithms may suffer
from heavy simplex volume computations in numerical optimization, etc. In this
work, without involving any simplex volume computations, by exploiting a convex
geometry fact that a simplest simplex of N vertices can be defined by N
associated hyperplanes, we propose a fast blind HU algorithm, for which each of
the N hyperplanes associated with the Craig's simplex of N vertices is
constructed from N-1 affinely independent data pixels, together with an
endmember identifiability analysis for its performance support. Without
resorting to numerical optimization, the devised algorithm searches for the
N(N-1) active data pixels via simple linear algebraic computations, accounting
for its computational efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations and real data
experiments are provided to demonstrate its superior efficacy over some
benchmark Craig-criterion-based algorithms in both computational efficiency and
estimation accuracy.
