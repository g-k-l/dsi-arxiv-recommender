 <dc:description>  We introduce a new notion of $\boxast$-product of two integrable series with
coefficients in distinct Grothendieck rings of algebraic varieties, preserving
the integrability and commuting with the limit of rational series. In the same
context, we define a motivic multiple zeta function with respect to an ordered
family of regular functions, which is integrable and connects closely to
Denef-Loeser's motivic zeta functions. We also show that the $\boxast$-product
is associative in the class of motivic multiple zeta functions.
  Furthermore, a version of the Euler reflexion formula for motivic zeta
functions is nicely formulated to deal with the $\boxast$-product and motivic
multiple zeta functions, and it is proved using the theory of arc spaces. As an
application, taking the limit for the motivic Euler reflexion formula we
recover the well known motivic Thom-Sebastiani theorem.
