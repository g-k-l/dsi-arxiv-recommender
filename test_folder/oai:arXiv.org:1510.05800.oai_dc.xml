 <dc:description>  In a setting, where only exit measures are given, as they are associated with
a right continuous strong Markov process on a separable metric space, we
provide simple criteria for scaling invariant H\"older continuity of bounded
harmonic functions with respect to a distance function which, in applications,
may be adapted to the special situation. In particular, already a very weak
scaling property ensures that Harnack inequalities imply H\"older continuity.
Our approach covers recent results by M. Kassmann and A. Mimica as well as
cases, where a Green function leads to an intrinsic metric.
