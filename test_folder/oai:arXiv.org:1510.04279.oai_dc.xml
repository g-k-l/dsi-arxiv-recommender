 <dc:description>  We construct a generalized transfer matrix corresponding to noninteracting
tight-binding lattice models, which can subsequently be used to compute the
bulk bands as well as the edge states. Crucially, our formalism works even in
cases where the hopping matrix is non-invertible. Following Hatsugai [PRL 71,
3697 (1993)], we explicitly construct the energy Riemann surfaces associated
with the band structure for a specific class of systems which includes systems
like Chern insulator, Dirac semimetal and graphene. The edge states can then be
interpreted as non-contractible loops, with the winding number equal to the
bulk Chern number. For these systems, the transfer matrix is symplectic, and
hence we also describe the windings associated with the edge states on $Sp(2,
\mathbb{R})$ and interpret the corresponding winding number as a Maslov index.
