 <dc:description>  It is demonstrated that novel spin frustration can be induced in ferromagnets
with nonuniform Land\'{e} $g$-factors. The frustrated state is characterized by
a mutual interplay of typical ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF)
features, such as the zero-field susceptibility being FM-like at low
temperatures but AF-like at high temperatures. It is also found to contain an
exotic zero-temperature `half fire, half ice' critical point at which the spins
on one sublattice are fully disordered and on the other one are fully ordered.
We suggest that such frustration may occur in a number of copper-iridium oxides
such as Sr$_3$CuIrO$_6$. We also anticipate a realization of the frustration
and `partial fire, partial ice' states in certain antiferromagnets, lattice
gas, and neuron systems.
