 <dc:description>  We have determined the detailed star formation history and total mass of the
globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal using archival HST WFPC2 data.
Colour magnitude diagrams are constructed in the F555W and F814W bands and
corrected for the effect of Fornax field star contamination, after which we use
the routine Talos to derive the quantitative star formation history as a
function of age and metallicity. The star formation history of the Fornax
globular clusters shows that Fornax 1, 2, 3 and 5 are all dominated by ancient
(&gt;10 Gyr) populations. Cluster Fornax 1,2 and 3 display metallicities as low as
[Fe/H]=-2.5 while Fornax 5 is slightly more metal-rich at [Fe/H]=-1.8,
consistent with resolved and unresolved metallicity tracers. Conversely, Fornax
4 is dominated by a more metal-rich~([Fe/H]=-1.2) and younger population at 10
Gyr, inconsistent with the other clusters. A lack of stellar populations
overlapping with the main body of Fornax argues against the nucleus cluster
scenario for Fornax 4. The combined stellar mass in globular clusters as
derived from the SFH is (9.57$\pm$0.93)$\times$10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ which
corresponds to 2.5$\pm$0.2 percent of the total stellar mass in Fornax. The
mass of the four most metal-poor clusters can be further compared to the
metal-poor Fornax field to yield a mass fraction of 19.6$\pm$3.1 percent.
Therefore, the SFH results provide separate supporting evidence for the
unusually high mass fraction of the GCs compared to the Fornax field
population.
