 <dc:description>  The time-dynamics of quantum correlations in the quantum transverse
anisotropic XY spin chain of infinite length is studied at zero as well as
finite temperatures. The evolution occurs due to the instantaneous quenching of
the coupling constant between the nearest-neighbor spins of the model, which is
either performed within the same phase or across the quantum phase transition
point connecting the order-disorder phases of the model. We characterize the
time-evolved quantum correlations, entanglement and quantum discord, which
exhibit varying behavior depending on the initial state and the quenching
scheme. We show that the system is endowed with enhanced bipartite quantum
correlations compared to that of the initial state, when quenched from ordered
to the deep disordered phase. However, bipartite quantum correlations are
almost washed out when the system is quenched from disordered to the ordered
phase with the initial state being at the zero-temperature. Moreover, we
identify the condition for the occurrence of enhanced bipartite correlations
when the system is quenched within the same phase. Finally, we investigate the
bipartite quantum correlations when the initial state is a thermal equilibrium
state with finite temperature which reveals the effects of thermal fluctuation
on the phenomena observed at zero-temperature.
