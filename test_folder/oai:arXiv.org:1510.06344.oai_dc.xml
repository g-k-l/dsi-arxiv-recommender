 <dc:description>  Light emitters or scatterers embedded in stratified media may couple energy
to both free space modes and guided modes of the stratified structure. For a
comprehensive analysis, it is important to evaluate the angular intensity
distribution of both the free-space modes and guided modes excited in such
systems. In the present work, we propose an original method based on
Lorentz-reciprocity theorem to efficiently calculate the free-space and guided
radiation diagrams with a high accuracy from the sole knowledge of the
near-field around the emitters or scatterers. Compared to conventional
near-to-far field transformation techniques, the proposal allows one to easily
evaluate the guided-mode radiation diagrams, even if material dissipation is
present in the stack, and thus to simultaneously track the coupling of light to
all channels (i.e., free-space and guided-ones). We also provide an open-source
code that may be used with essentially any Maxwell's equation solver. The
numerical tool may help to engineer various devices, such as light-emitting
diodes or nanoantennas to achieve directional and efficient radiative
spontaneous decays in free space and guided optics.
