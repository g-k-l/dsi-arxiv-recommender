 <dc:description>  Two concepts of centrality have been defined in complex networks. The first
considers the centrality of a node and many different metrics for it has been
defined (e.g. eigenvector centrality, PageRank, non-backtracking centrality,
etc). The second is related to a large scale organization of the network, the
core-periphery structure, composed by a dense core plus an outlying and
loosely-connected periphery. In this paper we investigate the relation between
these two concepts. We consider networks generated via the Stochastic Block
Model, or its degree corrected version, with a strong core-periphery structure
and we investigate the centrality properties of the core nodes and the ability
of several centrality metrics to identify them. We find that the three measures
with the best performance are marginals obtained with belief propagation,
PageRank, and degree centrality, while non-backtracking and eigenvector
centrality (or MINRES}, showed to be equivalent to the latter in the large
network limit) perform worse in the investigated networks.
