 <dc:description>  Cilia and flagella often exhibit synchronized behavior; this includes phase
locking, as seen in {\it Chlamydomonas}, and metachronal wave formation in the
respiratory cilia of higher organisms. Since the observations by Gray and
Rothschild of phase synchrony of nearby swimming spermatozoa, it has been a
working hypothesis that synchrony arises from hydrodynamic interactions between
beating filaments. Recent work on the dynamics of physically separated pairs of
flagella isolated from the multicellular alga {\it Volvox} has shown that
hydrodynamic coupling alone is sufficient to produce synchrony. However, the
situation is more complex in unicellular organisms bearing few flagella. We
show that flagella of {\it Chlamydomonas} mutants deficient in filamentary
connections between basal bodies display markedly different synchronization
from the wild type. We perform micromanipulation on configurations of flagella
and conclude that a mechanism, internal to the cell, must provide an additional
flagellar coupling. In naturally occurring species with 4, 8, or even 16
flagella, we find diverse symmetries of basal body positioning and of the
flagellar apparatus that are coincident with specific gaits of flagellar
actuation, suggesting that it is a competition between intracellular coupling
and hydrodynamic interactions that ultimately determines the precise form of
flagellar coordination in unicellular algae.
