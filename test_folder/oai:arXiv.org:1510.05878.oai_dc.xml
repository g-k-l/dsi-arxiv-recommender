 <dc:description>  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), as the largest space-based
astronomical observatory with near- and mid-infrared instrumentation, will
elucidate many mysterious aspects of comets. We summarize four cometary science
themes especially suited for this telescope and its instrumentation: the
drivers of cometary activity, comet nucleus heterogeneity, water ice in comae
and on surfaces, and activity in faint comets and main-belt asteroids. With
JWST, we can expect the most distant detections of gas, especially CO2, in what
we now consider to be only moderately bright comets. For nearby comets, coma
dust properties can be studied with their driving gases, measured
simultaneously with the same instrument or contemporaneously with another.
Studies of water ice and gas in the distant Solar System will help us test our
understanding of cometary interiors and coma evolution. The question of
cometary activity in main-belt comets will be further explored with the
possibility of a direct detection of coma gas. We explore the technical
approaches to these science cases and provide simple tools for estimating comet
dust and gas brightness. Finally, we consider the effects of the observatory's
non-sidereal tracking limits, and provide a list of potential comet targets
during the first 5 years of the mission.
