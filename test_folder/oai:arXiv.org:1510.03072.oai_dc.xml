 <dc:description>  Jet multiplicity distributions in top quark pair (t t-bar) events are
measured in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS
detector at the LHC using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity
of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The measurement is performed in the dilepton decay
channels (e+ e-, mu+ mu-, and e+/- mu-/+). The absolute and normalized
differential cross sections for t t-bar production are measured as a function
of the jet multiplicity in the event for different jet transverse momentum
thresholds and the kinematic properties of the leading additional jets. The
differential t t-bar b and t t-bar b b-bar cross sections are presented for the
first time as a function of the kinematic properties of the leading additional
b jets. Furthermore, the fraction of events without additional jets above a
threshold is measured as a function of the transverse momenta of the leading
additional jets and the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all additional
jets. The data are compared and found to be consistent with predictions from
several perturbative quantum chromodynamics event generators and a
next-to-leading order calculation.
