 <dc:description>  Fast Nearest Neighbor (NN) search is a fundamental challenge in large-scale
data processing and analytics, particularly for analyzing multimedia contents
which are often of high dimensionality. Instead of using exact NN search,
extensive research efforts have been focusing on approximate NN search
algorithms. In this work, we present "HDIdx", an efficient high-dimensional
indexing library for fast approximate NN search, which is open-source and
written in Python. It offers a family of state-of-the-art algorithms that
convert input high-dimensional vectors into compact binary codes, making them
very efficient and scalable for NN search with very low space complexity.
