 <dc:description>  An external, time-dependent perturbing potential acting upon a quantum system
can lead to transitions between its eigenstates which oscillate in time. In
this paper we present an approximate analytic solution for the temporal
evolution of the system in response to an arbitrary perturbing Hamiltonian that
has been decomposed into its Fourier modes. We impose no restriction upon the
number of eigenstates of the system nor upon the structure of the perturbing
Hamiltonian, the number of Fourier modes, their amplitude or their frequencies.
New terms appear in our results indicating new avenues by which the frequencies
and amplitudes of the modes may affect the transition probabilities. We
consider two applications of the theory to neutrino flavor transformation
through matter. The first is the effect of two sinusoidal density fluctuations
upon a three flavor neutrino where we find the phenomenon of induced
transparency. The second is the case of a mono-energetic, neutrino
self-interaction Hamiltonian with constant coupling. In both applications we
demonstrate how the analytic solutions are able to match the amplitude and
wavenumber of the numerical results to within a few percent.
