 <dc:description>  Using holography we have studied the time-dependent potential of a
quark-antiquark pair in a dynamical strongly coupled plasma. The time-dependent
plasma, whose dynamics is originated from the energy injection, is dual to
AdS-Vaidya background. The quark-antiquark pair is represented by the endpoints
of a string stretched from the boundary to the bulk. The evolution of the
system is studied by evaluating the potential between quark and anti-quark,
extracted from the expectation value of the Wilson loop, throughout the
process. Our results show that the time-dependent potential depends on the
speed of injecting energy as well as the final temperature of the plasma. For
high enough temperatures and rapid energy injection, the potential starts
oscillating around its equilibrium value, immediately after the injection.
