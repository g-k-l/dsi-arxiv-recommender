 <dc:description>  A cosmological analysis considering the inclusion of dark energy and dark
matter cosmic components in the context of some particular cases for
intersecting S-brane solutions is presented and discussed. Direct solution of
$d$-dim field equations and dimensional reduction processes, are implemented
for the pure dark energy and dark energy with dark matter cosmological
scenarios, respectively. In the first case, explicit expressions and evolution
for $d$-dim scale factors are founded and studied. Secondly, a low energy
effective $4$-dim model is obtained analytically and their resulting field
equations are solved numerically. The role of internal space geometry is always
a central element of our analysis. In some intersecting cases and under certain
considerations, a suitable late-time cosmic acceleration description is founded
and an adequate behavior for scale factor $a(t)$ and realistic values for dark
energy $\Omega_{DE}$ and dark matter $\Omega_{DM}$ relative energy densities
are obtained as well. As a result, we do specifically obtain late-time cosmic
acceleration in one scenario where our universe makes part either of an
SM2$\bot$SM2 or an SM2$\bot$SM5 intersection. This could give rise to further
possible configurations where late-time cosmic acceleration is present.
