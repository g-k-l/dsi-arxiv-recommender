 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a switching control strategy to incrementally
stabilize a class of nonlinear dynamical systems. Exploiting recent results on
contraction analysis of switched Filippov systems derived using regularization,
sufficient conditions are presented to prove incremental stability of the
closed-loop system. Furthermore, based on these sufficient conditions, a design
procedure is proposed to design a switched control action that is active only
where the open-loop system is not sufficiently incrementally stable in order to
reduce the required control effort. The design procedure to either locally or
globally incrementally stabilize a dynamical system is then illustrated by
means of a representative example.
