 <dc:description>  Exponential Random Graph models are an important tool in network analysis for
describing complicated dependency structures. However, Bayesian parameter
estimation for these models is extremely challenging, since evaluation of the
posterior distribution typically involves the calculation of an intractable
normalizing constant. This barrier motivates the consideration of tractable
approximations to the likelihood function, such as pseudolikelihoods, which
offer a principled approach to constructing such an approximation. Naive
implementation of a posterior from a misspecified model is likely to give
misleading inferences. We provide practical guidelines to calibrate in a quick
and efficient manner samples coming from an approximated posterior and discuss
the efficiency of this approach. The exposition of the methodology is
accompanied by the analysis of real-world graphs. Comparisons against the
Approximate Exchange algorithm of Caimo and Friel (2011) are provided, followed
by concluding remarks.
