 <dc:description>  The IceCube, Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Collaborations have recently
reported results on neutral particles (neutrons, photons and neutrinos) which
complement the measurements on charged primary cosmic rays at ultra-high
energy. The complementarity between these messengers and between their
detections are outlined. The current status of their search is reviewed and a
cross-correlation analysis between the available results is performed. The
expectations for photon and neutrino detections in the near future are also
presented.
