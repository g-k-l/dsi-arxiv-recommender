 <dc:description>  We construct a general measure for detecting the quantum speedup in both
closed and open systems. The speed measure is based on the changing rate of the
position of quantum states on a manifold with appropriate monotone Riemannian
metrics. Any increase in speed is a clear signature of dynamical speedup. To
clarify the mechanisms for quantum speedup, we first introduce the concept of
longitudinal and transverse types of speedup: the former stems from the time
evolution process itself with fixed initial conditions, while the latter is a
result of adjusting initial conditions. We then apply the proposed measure to
several typical closed and open quantum systems, illustrating that quantum
coherence (or entanglement) and the memory effect of the environment together
can become resources for longitudinally or transversely accelerating dynamical
evolution under specific conditions and assumptions.
