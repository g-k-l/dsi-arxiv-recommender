 <dc:description>  The electric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities for a relativistic
electron gas are calculated from quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature
and density as functions of temperature, chemical potential, frequency, and
wavevector. The polarization and the magnetization depend linearly on both
electric and magnetic fields, and are the sum of a zero-temperature and
zero-density vacuum part with a temperature- and chemical potential-dependent
medium part. Analytic calculations lead to generalized expressions that depend
on three scalar functions. In the nonrelativistic limit, results reproduce the
Lindhard formula. In the relativistic case, and in the long wavelength limit,
we obtain: i) for $\omega=0$, generalized susceptibilities that reduce to known
nonrelativistic limits; ii) for $\omega \neq 0$, Drude-type responses at zero
and at high temperatures. The latter implies that one may have both $\epsilon$
and $\mu$ simultaneously negative, a behavior characteristic of metamaterials.
This unambiguously indicates that the relativistic electron plasma is one of
nature's candidates for the realization of a negative index of refraction
system. Moreover, Maxwell's equations in the medium yield the dispersion
relation and the index of refraction of the electron plasma. Present results
should be relevant for plasma physics, astrophysical observations,
synchrotrons, and other environments with fast moving electrons.
