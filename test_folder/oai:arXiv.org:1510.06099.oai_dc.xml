 <dc:description>  Neutron stars with large masses $\sim 2M_{\odot}$ require the hard stiffness
of equation of state (EoS) of neutron-star matter. On the other hand, hyperon
mixing brings about remarkable softening of EoS. In order to solve this
problem, a multi-pomeron exchange potential (MPP) is introduced as a model for
the universal many-body repulsion in baryonic systems on the basis of the
Extended Soft Core (ESC) baryon-baryon interaction. The strength of MPP is
determined by analyzing the nucleus-nucleus scattering with the G-matrix
folding model. The interactions in $\Lambda\!N$, $\Sigma\!N$ and $\Xi\!N$
channels are shown to be consistent with experimental indications. The EoS in
neutron-star matter with hyperon mixing is obtained from ESC in addition of
MPP, and mass-radius relations of neutron stars are derived. The maximum mass
is shown to reach $2M_{\odot}$ even in the case of including hyperon mixing on
the basis of model-parameters determined by terrestrial experiments.
