 <dc:description>  V-T theory is constructed in the many-body Hamiltonian formulation, and
differs at the foundation from current liquid dynamics theories. In V-T theory
the liquid atomic motion consists of two contributions, normal mode vibrations
in a single representative potential energy valley, and transits, which carry
the system across boundaries between valleys. The mean square displacement time
correlation function (the MSD) is a direct measure of the atomic motion , and
our goal is to determine if the V-T formalism can produce a physically sensible
account of this motion. We employ molecular dynamics (MD) data for a system
representing liquid Na, and find the motion evolves in three successive time
intervals: On the first "vibrational" interval, the vibrational motion alone
gives a highly accurate account of the MD data; on the second "crossover"
interval, the vibrational MSD saturates to a constant while the transit motion
builds up from zero; on the third "random walk" interval, the transit motion
produces a purely diffusive random walk of the vibrational equilibrium
positions. This motional evolution agrees with, and adds refinement to, the MSD
atomic motion as described by current liquid dynamics theories.
