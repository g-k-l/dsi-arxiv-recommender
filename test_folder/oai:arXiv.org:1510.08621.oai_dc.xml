 <dc:description>  We introduce and investigate an SIS-type model for the spread of an
infectious disease, where the infected population is structured with respect to
the different strain of the virus/bacteria they are carrying. Our aim is to
capture the interesting scenario when individuals infected with different
strains cause secondary (new) infections at different rates. Therefore, we
consider a nonlinear infection process, which generalises the bilinear process
arising from the classic mass-action assumption. Our main motivation is to
study competition between different strains of a virus/bacteria. From the
mathematical point of view, we are interested whether the nonlinear infection
process leads to a well-posed model. We use a semilinear formulation to show
global existence and positivity of solutions up to a critical value of the
exponent in the nonlinearity. Furthermore, we establish the existence of the
endemic steady state for particular classes of nonlinearities.
