 <dc:description>  We found non singular solutions for universes filled with a fluid which obey
a Generalized Equation of State of the form
$P(\rho)=-A\rho+\gamma\rho^{\lambda}$. An emergent universe is obtained if
$A=1$ and $\lambda =1/2$. If the matter source is reinterpret as that of a
scalar matter field with some potential, the corresponding potential is
derived. For a closed universe, an exact bounce solution is found for $A=1/3$
and the same $\lambda $. We also explore how the composition of theses
universes can be interpreted in terms of known fluids. It is of interest to
note that accelerated solutions previously found for the late time evolution
also represent regular solutions at early times.
