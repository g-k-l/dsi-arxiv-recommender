 <dc:description>  Local galaxies with specific star-formation rates (star-formation rate per
unit mass; sSFR~0.2-10/Gyr) as high as distant galaxies (z~1-3), are very rich
in HI. Those with low stellar masses, log M_star (M_sun)=8-9, for example, have
M_HI/M_star~5-30. Using continuity arguments of Peng et al. (2014), whereby the
specific merger rate is hypothesized to be proportional to the specific
star-formation rate, and HI gas mass measurements for local galaxies with high
sSFR, we estimate that moderate mass galaxies, log M_star (M_sun)=9-10.5, can
acquire sufficient gas through minor mergers (stellar mass ratios ~4-100) to
sustain their star formation rates at z~2. The relative fraction of the gas
accreted through minor mergers declines with increasing stellar mass and for
the most massive galaxies considered, log M_star (M_sun)=10.5-11, this
accretion rate is insufficient to sustain their star formation. We checked our
minor merger hypothesis at z=0 using the same methodology but now with
relations for local normal galaxies and find that minor mergers cannot account
for their specific growth rates, in agreement with observations of HI-rich
satellites around nearby spirals. We discuss a number of attractive features,
like a natural down-sizing effect, in using minor mergers with extended HI
disks to support star formation at high redshift. The answer to the question
posed by the title, "Can galaxy growth be sustained through \HI-rich minor
mergers?", is maybe, but only for relatively low mass galaxies and at high
redshift.
