 <dc:description>  Ultracold atomic systems offer a unique tool for understanding behavior of
matter in the quantum degenerate regime, promising studies of a vast range of
phenomena covering many disciplines from condensed matter to quantum
information and particle physics. Coupling these systems to quantized light
fields opens further possibilities of observing delicate effects typical of
quantum optics in the context of strongly correlated systems. Measurement
backaction is one of the most fundamental manifestations of quantum mechanics
and it is at the core of many famous quantum optics experiments. Here we show
that quantum backaction of weak measurement can be used for tailoring
long-range correlations of ultracold fermions, realizing quantum states with
spatial modulations of the density and magnetization, thus overcoming usual
requirement for a strong interatomic interactions. We propose detection schemes
for implementing antiferromagnetic states and density waves. We demonstrate
that such long-range correlations cannot be realized with local addressing, and
they are a consequence of the competition between global but spatially
structured backaction of weak quantum measurement and unitary dynamics of
fermions.
