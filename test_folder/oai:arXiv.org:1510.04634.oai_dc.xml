 <dc:description>  Many-body localization (MBL) has emerged as a novel paradigm for robust
ergodicity breaking in closed quantum many-body systems. However, it is not yet
clear to which extent MBL survives in the presence of dissipative processes
induced by the coupling to an environment. Here we study heating and ergodicity
for a paradigmatic MBL system---an interacting fermionic chain subject to
quenched disorder---in the presence of dephasing. We find that, even though the
system is eventually driven into an infinite-temperature state, heating as
monitored by the von Neumann entropy can progress logarithmically slowly,
implying exponentially large time scales for relaxation. This slow loss of
memory of initial conditions make signatures of non-ergodicity visible over a
long, but transient, time regime. We point out a potential controlled
realization of the considered setup with cold atomic gases held in optical
lattices.
