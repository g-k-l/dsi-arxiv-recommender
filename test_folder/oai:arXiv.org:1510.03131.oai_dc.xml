 <dc:description>  We apply general relativity to construct the post-Newtonian background
manifold that serves as a reference spacetime in relativistic geodesy for
conducting relativistic calculation of the geoid's undulation and the
deflection of the plumb line from the vertical. We chose an axisymmetric
ellipsoidal body made up of perfect homogeneous fluid uniformly rotating around
a fixed axis, as a source generating the reference geometry. We, then,
reformulate and extend hydrodynamic calculations of rotating fluids done by
previous researchers to the realm of relativistic geodesy to set up algebraic
equations defining the shape of the post-Newtonian reference ellipsoid. To
complete this task, we explicitly perform all integrals characterizing
gravitational field inside the fluid body and represent them in terms of the
elementary functions depending on its eccentricity. We fully explore the
coordinate freedom of the equations describing the post-Newtonian ellipsoid and
demonstrate that the fractional deviation of the post-Newtonian level surface
from the Maclaurin ellipsoid can be made much smaller than the previously
anticipated estimate based on the coordinate gauge advocated by Bardeen and
Chandrasekhar. We also derive the gauge-invariant relations of the
post-Newtonian mass and the angular velocity of the rotating fluid with the
parameters characterizing the shape of the post-Newtonian ellipsoid. We
formulate the post-Newtonian theorems of Pizzetti and Clairaut that are used in
geodesy to connect the geometric parameters of the reference ellipsoid to the
physically measurable force of gravity at the pole and equator. Finally, we
expand the post-Newtonian geodetic equations to the Taylor series with respect
to the eccentricity of the ellipsoid and discuss their practical applications.
