 <dc:description>  The expected hitting time of discrete quantum walks on a hypercube (HC) is
numerically known to be exponentially shorter than that of their classical
analogs in terms of the scaling with the HC dimension. Recent numerical
analyses illustrated that this scaling exists not only on the bare HC, but also
when the HC graph is symmetrically and locally embedded into larger graphs. The
present work investigates the necessity of symmetry and locality for the
speed-up by considering embeddings that are nonsymmetric or nonlocal. We
provide numerical evidence that the exponential speed-up survives also in these
cases. Furthermore, our numerical simulations demonstrate that removing a
single edge from the HC also does not destroy the exponential speed-up. In the
nonlocal embedding of the HC we encounter dark states, which we analyze. We
provide a general and detailed presentation of the mapping that reduces the
exponentially large Hilbert space of the quantum walk to an effective subspace
of polynomial scaling. This mapping is our essential tool to numerically study
quantum walks in such high-dimensional structures.
