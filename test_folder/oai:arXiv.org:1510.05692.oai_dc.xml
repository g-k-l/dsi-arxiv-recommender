 <dc:description>  We complete the study of a class of string-motivated effective supergravity
theories in which modulus-induced soft supersymmetry breaking is sufficiently
suppressed in the observable sector so as to be competitive with
anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Here we consider deflected mirage
mediation (DMM), where contributions from gauge mediation are added to those
arising from gravity mediation and anomaly mediation. We update previous work
that surveyed the rich parameter space of such theories, in light of data from
the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and recent dark matter detection
experiments. Constraints arising from LHC superpartner searches at $\sqrt{s} =
8\,{\rm TeV}$ are considered, and discovery prospects at $\sqrt{s} = 14\,{\rm
TeV}$ are evaluated. We find that deflected mirage mediation generally allows
for SU(3)-charged superpartners of significantly lower mass (given current
knowledge of the Higgs mass and neutralino relic density) than was found for
the `pure' mirage mediation models of Kachru et al. Consequently, discovery
prospects are enhanced for many combinations of matter multiplet modular
weights. We examine the experimental challenges that will arise due to the
prospect of highly compressed spectra in DMM, and the correlation between
accessibility at the LHC and discovery prospects at large-scale liquid xenon
dark matter detectors.
