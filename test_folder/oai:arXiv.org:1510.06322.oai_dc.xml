 <dc:description>  Valid conditional inference has become a topic of increasing concern. Johnson
et al. (2016) provide a framework for understanding the difficulties presented
by using hypothesis testing to select a model. They also present an algorithm
for performing valid stepwise regression. We extend their results and provide
several practical improvements which yield an algorithm, Revisiting
Alpha-Investing (RAI), that provides a fast approximation to forward stepwise.
RAI performs model selection in $O(np\log(n))$ time while controlling type-I
error and provably finding signal: it controls the marginal false discovery
rate and selects a model that is a $(1-1/e)+\epsilon$ approximation to the best
model of the same size. The algorithm is successful under the assumption of
approximate submodularity, which is quite general and allows for highly
correlated explanatory variables. We demonstrate the adaptability of RAI by
using it to search complex interaction spaces in both simulated and real data.
