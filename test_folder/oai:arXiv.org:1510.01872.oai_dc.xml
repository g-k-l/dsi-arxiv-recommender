 <dc:description>  By means of first principles calculations we investigate the nature of
exchange coupling in ferromagnetic bcc Fe on a microscopic level. Analyzing the
basic electronic structure reveals a drastic difference between the $3d$
orbitals of $E_g$ and $T_{2g}$ symmetries. The latter ones define the shape of
the Fermi surface, while the former ones form weakly-interacting impurity
levels. We demonstrate that, as a result of this, in Fe the $T_{2g}$ orbitals
participate in exchange interactions, which are only weakly dependent on the
configuration of the spin moments and thus can be classified as
Heisenberg-like. These couplings are shown to be driven by Fermi surface
nesting. In contrast, for the $E_g$ states the Heisenberg picture breaks down,
since the corresponding contribution to the exchange interactions is shown to
strongly depend on the reference state they are extracted from. Our analysis of
the nearest-neighbour coupling indicates that the interactions among $E_g$
states are mainly proportional to the corresponding hopping integral and thus
can be attributed to be of double-exchange origin.
