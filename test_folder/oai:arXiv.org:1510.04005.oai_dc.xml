 <dc:description>  We present a new resummed mean field approximation for inferring the
parameters of an Ising or a Potts model from empirical, noisy, one- and
two-point correlation functions. Based on a resummation of a class of diagrams
of the small correlation expansion of the log-likelihood, the method
outperforms standard mean-field inference methods, even when they are
regularized. The inference is stable with respect to sampling noise, contrarily
to previous works based either on the small correlation expansion, on the Bethe
free-energy, or on the mean-field and Gaussian models. Because it is mostly
analytic, its complexity is still $\OO(N^3)$, requiring only matrix inversions
and multiplications. We test our algorithm on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
submitted to a random external field and large random couplings, and
demonstrate that even without regularization, the inference is stable across
the whole phase diagram. In addition, the calculation leads to a consistent
estimation of the entropy of the data, and allows to sample form the inferred
distribution to obtain artificial data that are consistent with the empirical
distribution.
