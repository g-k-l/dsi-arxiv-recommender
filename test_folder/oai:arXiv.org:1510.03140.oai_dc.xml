 <dc:description>  The Loschmidt echo is a measure of quantum irreversibility and is determined
by the fidelity amplitude of an imperfect time-reversal protocol. Fidelity
amplitude plays an important role both in the foundations of quantum mechanics
and its applications, such as time-resolved electronic spectroscopy. We derive
an exact path integral formula for the fidelity amplitude and use it to obtain
a series of increasingly accurate semiclassical approximations by truncating an
exact expansion of the path integral exponent. While the zeroth-order expansion
results in a remarkably simple, yet nontrivial approximation for the fidelity
amplitude, the first-order expansion yields an alternative derivation of the
so-called "dephasing representation", circumventing the use of semiclassical
propagator as in the original derivation. We also obtain approximate expression
for fidelity based on the second-order expansion, which resolves several
shortcomings of the dephasing representation. The rigorous derivation from the
path integral permits the identification of sufficient conditions under which
various approximations obtained become exact.
