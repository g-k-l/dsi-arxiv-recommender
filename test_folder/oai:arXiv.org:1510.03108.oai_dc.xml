 <dc:description>  The mechanical properties of amorphous solids like metallic glasses can be
dramatically changed by adding small concentrations (as low as 0.1\%) of
foreign elements. The glass-forming-ability, the ductility, the yield stress
and the elastic moduli can all be greatly effected. This paper presents
theoretical considerations with the aim of explaining the magnitude of these
changes in light of the small concentrations involved. The theory is built
around the experimental evidence that the microalloying elements organize
around them a neighborhood that differs from both the crystalline and the
glassy phases of the material in the absence of the additional elements. These
regions act as {\em isotropic} defects that in unstressed systems dress the
shear moduli. When strained, these defects interact with the incipient plastic
responses which are quadrupolar in nature. It will be shown that this
interaction interferes with the creation of system-spanning shear bands and
increases the yield strain. We offer experimentally testable estimates of the
lengths of nano-shear bands in the presence of the additional elements.
