 <dc:description>  Solution of fractional differential equations is an emerging area of present
day research because such equations arise in various applied fields. In this
paper we have developed analytical method to solve the system of fractional
differential equations in-terms of Mittag-Leffler function and generalized Sine
and Cosine functions, where the fractional derivative operator is of Jumarie
type. The use of Jumarie type fractional derivative, which is modified
Rieman-Liouvellie fractional derivative, eases the solution to such fractional
order systems. The use of this type of Jumarie fractional derivative gives a
conjugation with classical methods of solution of system of linear integer
order differential equations, by usage of Mittag-Leffler and generalized
trigonometric functions. The ease of this method and its conjugation to
classical method to solve system of linear fractional differential equation is
appealing to researchers in fractional dynamic systems. Here after developing
the method, the algorithm is applied in physical system of fractional
differential equation. The analytical results obtained are then graphically
plotted for several examples for system of linear fractional differential
equation.
