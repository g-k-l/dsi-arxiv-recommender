 <dc:description>  Quantum annealing correction (QAC) is a method that combines encoding with
energy penalties and decoding to suppress and correct errors that degrade the
performance of quantum annealers in solving optimization problems. While QAC
has been experimentally demonstrated to successfully error-correct a range of
optimization problems, a clear understanding of its operating mechanism has
been lacking. Here we bridge this gap using tools from quantum statistical
mechanics. We study analytically tractable models using a mean-field analysis,
specifically the $p$-body ferromagnetic infinite-range transverse-field Ising
model as well as the quantum Hopfield model. We demonstrate that for $p=2$,
where the phase transition is of second order, QAC pushes the transition to
increasingly larger transverse field strengths. For $p\ge3$, where the phase
transition is of first order, QAC softens the closing of the gap for small
energy penalty values and prevents its closure for sufficiently large energy
penalty values. Thus QAC provides protection from excitations that occur near
the quantum critical point. We find similar results for the Hopfield model,
thus demonstrating that our conclusions hold in the presence of disorder.
