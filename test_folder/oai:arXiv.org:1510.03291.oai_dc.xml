 <dc:description>  This paper sets out to establish a comparative study between classes of spin-
and velocity-dependent potentials for spin-1/2 and spin-1 matter
currents/sources in the non-relativistic regime. Both (neutral massive) scalar
and vector particles are considered to mediate the interactions between
(pseudo-)scalar sources or (pseudo-)vector currents. Though our discussion is
more general, we contemplate specific cases in which our results may describe
the electromagnetic interaction with a massive (Proca-type) photon exchanged
between two spin-1/2 or two spin-1 carriers. We highlight the similarities and
peculiarities of the potentials for the two different types of charged matter
and also focus our attention on the comparison between the particular aspects
of two different field representations for spin-1 matter particles. We believe
that our results may contribute to a further discussion of the relation between
charge, spin and extensibility of elementary particles.
