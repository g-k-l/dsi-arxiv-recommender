 <dc:description>  Entanglement is a resource to overcome the natural restriction of operations
used for state manipulation to Local Operations assisted by Classical
Communication (LOCC). Hence, a bipartite maximally entangled state is a state
which can be transformed deterministically into any other state via LOCC. In
the multipartite setting no such state exists. There, rather a whole set, the
Maximally Entangled Set of states (MES), which we recently introduced, is
required. This set has on the one hand the property that any state outside of
this set can be obtained via LOCC from one of the states within the set and on
the other hand, no state in the set can be obtained from any other state via
LOCC. Recently, we studied LOCC transformations among pure multipartite states
and derived the MES for 3- and generic 4-qubit states. Here, we consider the
non-generic 4-qubit states and analyze their properties regarding local
transformations. We prove that most SLOCC classes show a similar behavior as
the generic states, however we also identify three classes with very distinct
properties. The first consists of the GHZ and W class, where any state can be
transformed into some other state non-trivially. In particular, there exists no
isolation. On the other hand, there also exist classes where all states are
isolated. Last but not least we identify an additional class of states, whose
transformation properties differ drastically from all the other classes. Our
investigations do not only identify the most relevant classes of states for
LOCC entanglement manipulation, but also reveal new insight into the
similarities and differences between separable and LOCC transformations and
enable the investigation of LOCC transformations among arbitrary four qubit
states.
