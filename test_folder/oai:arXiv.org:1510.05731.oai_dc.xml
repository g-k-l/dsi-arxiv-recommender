 <dc:description>  We describe a new method of constructing transcendental entire functions $A$
such that the differential equation $w"+Aw=0$ has two linearly independent
solutions with relatively few zeros. In particular, we solve a problem of Bank
and Laine by showing that there exist entire functions $A$ of any prescribed
order greater than $1/2$ such that the differential equation has two linearly
independent solutions whose zeros have finite exponent of convergence. We show
that partial results by Bank, Laine, Langley, Rossi and Shen related to this
problem are in fact best possible. We also improve a result of Toda and show
that the resulting estimate is best possible. Our method is based on gluing
solutions of the Schwarzian differential equation $S(F)=2A$ for infinitely many
coefficients $A$.
