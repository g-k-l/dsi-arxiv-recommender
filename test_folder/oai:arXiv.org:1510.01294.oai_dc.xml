 <dc:description>  Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows for communication with security
guaranteed by quantum theory. The main theoretical problem in QKD is to
calculate the secret key rate for a given protocol. Analytical formulas are
known for protocols with symmetries, since symmetry simplifies the analysis.
However, experimental imperfections break symmetries, hence the effect of
imperfections on key rates is difficult to estimate. Furthermore, it is an
interesting question whether (intentionally) asymmetric protocols could
outperform symmetric ones. Here, we develop a robust numerical approach for
calculating the key rate for arbitrary discrete-variable QKD protocols.
Ultimately this will allow researchers to study "unstructured" protocols, that
is, those that lack symmetry. Our approach relies on transforming the key rate
calculation to the dual optimization problem, which dramatically reduces the
number of parameters and hence the calculation time. We illustrate our method
by investigating some unstructured protocols for which the key rate was
previously unknown.
