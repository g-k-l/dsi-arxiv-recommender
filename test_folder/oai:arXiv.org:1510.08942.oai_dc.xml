 <dc:description>  Networks of open quantum systems with feedback have become an active area of
research for applications such as quantum control, quantum communication and
coherent information processing. A canonical formalism for the interconnection
of open quantum systems using quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs)
has been developed by Gough, James and co-workers and has been used to develop
practical modeling approaches for complex quantum optical, microwave and
optomechanical circuits/networks. In this paper we fill a significant gap in
existing methodology by showing how trapped modes resulting from feedback via
coupled channels with finite propagation delays can be identified
systematically in a given passive linear network. Our method is based on the
Blaschke-Potapov multiplicative factorization theorem for inner matrix-valued
functions, which has been applied in the past to analog electronic networks.
Our results provide a basis for extending the Quantum Hardware Description
Language (QHDL) framework for automated quantum network model construction
(Tezak \textit{et al.} in Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A, Math. Phys. Eng. Sci.
370(1979):5270-5290, to efficiently treat scenarios in which each
interconnection of components has an associated signal propagation time delay.
