 <dc:description>  Despite our growing reliance on mobile phones for a wide range of daily
tasks, their operation remains largely opaque. A number of previous studies
have addressed elements of this problem in a partial fashion, trading off
analytic comprehensiveness and deployment scale. We overcome the barriers to
large-scale deployment (e.g., requiring rooted devices) and comprehensiveness
of previous efforts by taking a novel approach that leverages the VPN API on
mobile devices to design Haystack, an in-situ mobile measurement platform that
operates exclusively on the device, providing full access to the device's
network traffic and local context without requiring root access. We present the
design of Haystack and its implementation in an Android app that we deploy via
standard distribution channels. Using data collected from 450 users of the app,
we exemplify the advantages of Haystack over the state of the art and
demonstrate its seamless experience even under demanding conditions. We also
demonstrate its utility to users and researchers in characterizing mobile
traffic and privacy risks.
