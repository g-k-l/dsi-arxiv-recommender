 <dc:title>Hidden attractors in fundamental problems and engineering models</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently a concept of self-excited and hidden attractors was suggested: an
attractor is called a self-excited attractor if its basin of attraction
overlaps with neighborhood of an equilibrium, otherwise it is called a hidden
attractor. For example, hidden attractors are attractors in systems with no
equilibria or with only one stable equilibrium (a special case of
multistability and coexistence of attractors). While coexisting self-excited
attractors can be found using the standard computational procedure, there is no
standard way of predicting the existence or coexistence of hidden attractors in
a system. In this plenary survey lecture the concept of self-excited and hidden
attractors is discussed, and various corresponding examples of self-excited and
hidden attractors are considered.
