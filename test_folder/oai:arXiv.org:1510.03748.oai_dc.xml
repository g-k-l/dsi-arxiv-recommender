 <dc:description>  We consider a superconducting microwave cavity capacitively coupled to both a
quantum conductor and its electronic reservoirs. We analyze in details how the
measurements of the cavity microwave field, which are related to the electronic
charge susceptibility, can be used to extract information on the transport
properties of the quantum conductor. We show that the asymmetry of the
capacitive couplings between the electronic reservoirs and the cavity plays a
crucial role in relating optical measurements to transport properties. For
asymmetric capacitive couplings, photonic measurements can be used to probe the
finite low frequency admittance of the quantum conductor, the real part of
which being related to the differential conductance. In particular, when the
quantum dot is far from resonance, the charge susceptibility is directly
proportional to the admittance for a large range of frequencies and voltages.
However, when the quantum conductor is near a resonance, such a relation
generally holds only at low frequency and for equal tunnel coupling or low
voltage. Beyond this low-energy near equilibrium regime, the charge
susceptibility and thus the optical transmission offers new insights on the
quantum conductors since the optical observables are not directly connected to
transport quantities. For symmetric lead capacitive couplings, we show that the
optical measurements can be used to reveal the Korringa-Shiba relation,
connecting the reactive to the dissipative part of the susceptibility, at low
frequency and low bias.
