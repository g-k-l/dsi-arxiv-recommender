 <dc:title>Tidal Downsizing Model. IV. Destructive feedback in planets</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  I argue that feedback is as important to formation of planets as it is to
formation of stars and galaxies. Energy released by massive solid cores puffs
up pre-collapse gas giant planets, making them vulnerable to tidal disruptions
by their host stars. I find that feedback is the ultimate reason for some of
the most robust properties of the observed exoplanet populations: the rarity of
gas giants at all separations from $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 100$~AU, the abundance
of $\sim 10 M_\oplus$ cores but dearth of planets more massive than $\sim 20
M_\oplus$. Feedback effects can also explain (i) rapid assembly of massive
cores at large separations as needed for Uranus, Neptune and the suspected HL
Tau planets; (ii) the small core in Jupiter yet large cores in Uranus and
Neptune; (iii) the existence of rare "metal monster" planets such as CoRoT-20b,
a gas giant made of heavy elements by up to $\sim 50$\%.
