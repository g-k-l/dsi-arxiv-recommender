 <dc:description>  Jets are observed as radio emission in active galactic nuclei and during the
low/hard state in X-ray binaries (XRBs), but their contribution at higher
frequencies has been uncertain. We study the dynamics of jets in XRBs using the
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code HARM. We calculate the
high-energy spectra and variability properties using a general-relativistic
radiative transport code based on grmonty. We find the following signatures of
jet emission (i) a significant gamma-ray peak above ~10^22 Hz, (ii) a break in
the optical/UV spectrum, with a change in luminosity from L ~ nu^0 to L ~ nu,
followed by another break at higher frequencies where the spectrum roughly
returns to L ~ nu^0, and (iii) a pronounced synchrotron peak near or below
~10^14 Hz indicates that a significant fraction of any observed X-ray emission
originates in the jet. We investigate the variability during a large-scale
magnetic field inversion in which the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet is quenched and
a new transient hot reconnecting plasmoid is launched by the reconnecting
field. The ratio of the gamma-rays to X-rays changes from L_gamma / L_X &gt; 1 in
the BZ jet to L_gamma / L_X &lt; 1 during the launching of the transient plasmoid.
