 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the lepton favor violating decay channels of the
neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model into a lepton
and an anti-lepton of different flavor. We work in the context of the most
general flavor mixing scenario in the slepton sector, in contrast to the
minimal flavor violation assumption more frequently used. Our analytic
computation is a one-loop diagrammatic one, but in contrast to the full
one-loop computation which is usually referred to the physical slepton mass
basis, we use here instead the Mass Insertion Approximation (MIA) which uses
the electroweak interaction slepton basis and treats perturbatively the mass
insertions changing slepton flavor. By performing an expansion in powers of the
external momenta in the relevant form factors, we will be able to separate
explicitly in the analytic results the leading non-decoupling (constant at
asymptotically large sparticle masses) and the next to leading decoupling
contributions (decreasing with the sparticle masses). Our final aim is to
provide a set of simple analytic formulas for the form factors and the
associated effective vertices, that we think may be very useful for future
phenomenological studies of the lepton flavor violating Higgs boson decays, and
for their comparison with data. The accuracy of the numerical results obtained
with the MIA are also analyzed and discussed here in comparison with the full
one-loop results. Our most optimistic numerical estimates for the three neutral
Higgs boson decays channels into $\tau$ and $\mu$ leptons, searching for their
maximum rates that are allowed by present constraints from $\tau \to \mu
\gamma$ data and beyond Standard Model Higgs boson searches at the LHC, are
also included.
