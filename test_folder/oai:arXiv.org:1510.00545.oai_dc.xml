 <dc:description>  There is a recently discovered connection between the spectral theory of
Schr\"o-dinger operators whose potentials exhibit aperiodic order and that of
Laplacians associated with actions of groups on regular rooted trees, as
Grigorchuk's group of intermediate growth. We give an overview of corresponding
results, such as different spectral types in the isotropic and anisotropic
cases, including Cantor spectrum of Lebesgue measure zero and absence of
eigenvalues. Moreover, we discuss the relevant background as well as the
combinatorial and dynamical tools that allow one to establish the
afore-mentioned connection. The main such tool is the subshift associated to a
substitution over a finite alphabet that defines the group algebraically via a
recursive presentation by generators and relators.
