 <dc:title>New thoughts on an old riddle: what determines genetic diversity within
  and between species?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The question of what determines genetic diversity both between and within
species has long remained unsolved by the modern evolutionary theory (MET).
However, it has not deterred researchers from producing interpretations of
genetic diversity by using MET. We here examine the two key experimental
observations of genetic diversity made in the 1960s, one between species and
the other within a population of a species, that directly contributed to the
development of MET. The interpretations of these observations as well as the
assumptions by MET are widely known to be inadequate. We review the recent
progress of an alternative framework, the maximum genetic diversity (MGD)
hypothesis, that uses axioms and natural selection to explain the vast majority
of genetic diversity as being at optimum equilibrium that is largely determined
by organismal complexity. The MGD hypothesis fully absorbs the proven virtues
of MET and considers its assumptions relevant only to a much more limited
scope. This new synthesis has accounted for the much overlooked phenomenon of
progression towards higher complexity, and more importantly, been instrumental
in directing productive research into both evolutionary and biomedical
problems.
