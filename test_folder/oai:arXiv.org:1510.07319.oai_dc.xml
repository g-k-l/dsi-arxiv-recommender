 <dc:title>LHCO_reader: A new code for reading and analyzing detector-level events
  stored in LHCO format</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a new Python module - LHCO_reader - for reading detector-level
events in LHCO format generated from detector-simulators such as PGS and
Delphes. Emphasis is placed upon ease of use. The module is installed via pip.
Once installed, one can read and scrutinize events, with helpful functions and
classes for cutting, plotting and inspecting events, and manipulating
four-momenta by e.g. boosting. Implementing complicated analyses should be
straight-forward by coding any cuts into Python. Furthermore, common kinematic
variables, including $\alpha_T$ and razor are included out of the box, and
$m_{T2}$ and $m_{T2}^W$ are provided by interfaces with external libraries.
