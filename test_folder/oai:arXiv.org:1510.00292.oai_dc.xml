 <dc:description>  Contemporary tasks of complex system simulation are often related to the
issue of uncertainty management. It comes from the lack of information or
knowledge about the simulated system as well as from restrictions of the model
set being used. One of the powerful tools for the uncertainty management is
ensemble-based simulation, which uses variation in input or output data, model
parameters, or available versions of models to improve the simulation
performance. Furthermore the system of models for complex system simulation
(especially in case of hiring ensemble-based approach) can be considered as a
complex system. As a result, the identification of the complex model's
structure and parameters provide additional sources of uncertainty to be
managed. Within the presented work we are developing a conceptual and
technological approach to manage the ensemble-based simulation taking into
account changing states of both simulated system and system of models within
the ensemble-based approach. The states of these systems are considered as a
subject of classification with consequent inference of better strategies for
ensemble evolution over the simulation time and ensemble aggregation. Here the
ensemble evolution enables implementation of dynamic reactive solutions which
can automatically conform to the changing states of both systems. The ensemble
aggregation can be considered within a scope of averaging (regression way) or
selection (classification way, which complement the classification mentioned
earlier) approach. The technological basis for such approach includes
ensemble-based simulation techniques using domain-specific software combined
within a composite application; data science approaches for analysis of
available datasets (simulation data, observations, situation assessment etc.);
and machine learning algorithms for classes identification, ensemble management
and knowledge acquisition.
