 <dc:description>  This technical note studies the distributed optimization problem of a sum of
nonsmooth convex cost functions with local constraints. At first, we propose a
novel distributed continuous-time projected algorithm, in which each agent
knows its local cost function and local constraint set, for the constrained
optimization problem. Then we prove that all the agents of the algorithm can
find the same optimal solution, and meanwhile, keep the states bounded while
seeking the optimal solutions. We conduct a complete convergence analysis by
employing nonsmooth Lyapunov functions for the stability analysis of
discontinuous systems. Finally, we provide a numerical example for
illustration.
