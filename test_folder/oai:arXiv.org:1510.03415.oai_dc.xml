 <dc:description>  We study the local controllability properties of 2D and 3D bio-mimetic
swimmers employing the change of their geometric shape to propel themselves in
an incompressible fluid described by Navier-Stokes equations. It is assumed
that swimmers' bodies consist of finitely many parts, identified with the fluid
they occupy, that are subsequently linked by the rotational and elastic
internal forces. These forces are explicitly described and serve as the means
to affect the geometric configuration of swimmers' bodies. Similar models were
previously investigated in [6]-[13].
