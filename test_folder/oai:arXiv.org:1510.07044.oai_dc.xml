 <dc:description>  We analytically study the lightcone limit of the conformal bootstrap for
4-point functions containing scalars charged under global symmetries. We show
the existence of large spin double-twist operators in various representations
of the global symmetry group. We then compute their anomalous dimensions in
terms of the central charge $C_T$, current central charge $C_J$, and the OPE
coefficients of low dimension scalars. In AdS, these results correspond to the
binding energy of two-particle states arising from the exchange of gravitons,
gauge bosons, and light scalar fields. Using unitarity and crossing symmetry,
we show that gravity is universal and attractive among different types of
two-particle states, while the gauge binding energy can have either sign as
determined by the representation of the two-particle state, with universal
ratios fixed by the symmetry group. We apply our results to 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$
SQCD and the 3D O(N) vector models. We also show that in a unitary CFT, if the
current central charge $C_J$ stays finite when the global symmetry group
becomes infinitely large, such as the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit of the O(N)
vector model, then the theory must contain an infinite number of higher spin
currents.
