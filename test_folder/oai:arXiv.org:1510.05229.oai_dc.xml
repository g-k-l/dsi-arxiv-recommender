 <dc:description>  We study the monotonicity properties of solutions in the classic problem of
fair cake-cutting - dividing a heterogeneous resource among agents with
different preferences. Resource- and population-monotonicity relate to
scenarios where the cake, or the number of participants who divide the cake,
changes. It is required that the utility of all participants change in the same
direction: either all of them are better-off (if there is more to share) or all
are worse-off (if there is less to share). We formally introduce these concepts
to the cake-cutting setting and study several division rules. We prove that the
Nash optimal rule, which maximizes the product of utilities, is Pareto-optimal,
envy-free, resource-monotonic and population-monotonic. We derive this result
in two ways: once directly, and once by showing that the Nash optimal rule is
equivalent to the rule of competitive-equilibrium-from-equal-incomes. Moreover,
we prove that it is the only rule among a natural family of welfare-maximizing
rules that is both proportional and resource-monotonic. In contrast, other
members of this family, like the utilitarian and leximin rules, are either not
proportional or not resource-monotonic.
