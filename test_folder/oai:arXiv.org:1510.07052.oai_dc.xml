 <dc:description>  There are many open questions about prebiotic chemistry in both planetary and
exoplanetary environments. The increasing number of known exoplanets and other
ultra-cool, substellar objects has propelled the desire to detect life and
prebiotic chemistry outside the solar system. We present an ion-neutral
chemical network constructed from scratch, Stand2015, that treats hydrogen,
nitrogen, carbon and oxygen chemistry accurately within a temperature range
between 100 K and 30000 K. Formation pathways for glycine and other organic
molecules are included. The network is complete up to H6C2N2O3. Stand2015 is
successfully tested against atmospheric chemistry models for HD209458b, Jupiter
and the present-day Earth using a simple 1D photochemistry/diffusion code. Our
results for the early Earth agree with those of Kasting (1993) for CO2, H2, CO
and O2, but do not agree for water and atomic oxygen. We use the network to
simulate an experiment where varied chemical initial conditions are irradiated
by UV light. The result from our simulation is that more glycine is produced
when more ammonia and methane is present. Very little glycine is produced in
the absence of any molecular nitrogen and oxygen. This suggests that production
of glycine is inhibited if a gas is too strongly reducing. Possible
applications and limitations of the chemical kinetics network are also
discussed.
