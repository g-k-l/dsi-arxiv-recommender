 <dc:description>  We study one- and two-photon scattering from a qubit embedded in a
one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of modal dispersion. We use a
resolvent based analysis and utilize techniques borrowed from the Lee model
studies. Modal dispersion leads to atom-photon bound states which necessitate
the use of multichannel scattering theory. We present multichannel scattering
matrix elements in terms of the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the
second kind. Through the use of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, we derive an
infinite series of Feynman diagrams that represent the solution to the integral
equation. We use the Feynman diagrams as vertex correction terms to come up
with closed form formulas that successfully predict the trapping rate of a
photon in the atom-photon bound state. We verify our formalism through
Krylov-subspace based numerical studies with pulsed excitations. Our results
provide the tools to calculate the complex correlations between scattered
photons in a dispersive environment.
