 <dc:description>  This paper reports the results of a survey of 1,976 individuals regarding
their opinions on TLS inspection, a controversial technique that can be used
for both benevolent and malicious purposes. Responses indicate that
participants hold nuanced opinions on security and privacy trade-offs, with
most recognizing legitimate uses for the practice, but also concerned about
threats from hackers or government surveillance. There is strong support for
notification and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted traffic,
although this support varies depending on the situation. A significant concern
about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react
negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection
occurring without their knowledge. We also find that there are a small but
significant number of participants who are jaded by the current state of
affairs and have no expectation of privacy.
