 <dc:description>  We investigate constraints on neutron star structure arising from the
assumptions that neutron stars have crusts, that recent calculations of pure
neutron matter limit the equation of state of neutron star matter near the
nuclear saturation density, that the high-density equation of state is limited
by causality and the largest high-accuracy neutron star mass measurement, and
that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity. We explore the role
of prior assumptions by considering two classes of equation of state models. In
a first, the intermediate- and high-density behavior of the equation of state
is parameterized by piecewise polytropes. In the second class, the high-density
behavior of the equation of state is parameterized by piecewise continuous line
segments. The smallest density at which high-density matter appears is varied
in order to allow for strong phase transitions above the nuclear saturation
density. We critically examine correlations among the pressure of matter,
radii, maximum masses, the binding energy, the moment of inertia, and the tidal
deformability, paying special attention to the sensitivity of these
correlations to prior assumptions about the equation of state. It is possible
to constrain the radii of $1.4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ neutron stars to a be larger
than 10 km, even without consideration of additional astrophysical
observations, for example, those from photospheric radius expansion bursts or
quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. We are able to improve the accuracy of known
correlations between the moment of inertia and compactness as well as the
binding energy and compactness. We also demonstrate the existence of a
correlation between the neutron star binding energy and the moment of inertia.
