 <dc:description>  We explore a time-dependent energy dissipation of the energetic electrons in
the inhomogeneous intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of cosmic
reionization. In addition to the atomic processes we take into account the
Inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the electrons on the comic microwave
background (CMB) photons, which is the dominant channel of energy loss for the
electrons with energies above a few MeV. We show that: (1) the effect on the
IGM has both local (atomic processes) and non-local (IC radiation) components;
(2) the energy distribution between Hydrogen and Helium ionizations depends on
the initial electron energy; (3) the local baryon overdensity significantly
affects the fractions of energy distributed in each channel; and (4) the
relativistic effect of atomic cross section become important during the epoch
of cosmic reionization. We release our code as open source for further
modification by the community.
