 <dc:description>  We suggest that the "Big Bang" may be a result of the first-order phase
transition driven by changing scalar curvature of the 4D space-time in
expanding cold Universe, filled with nonlinear scalar field $\phi $ and neutral
matter with equation of state $p=\nu \varepsilon $ (where $p$ and $\varepsilon
$ are pressure and energy density of matter). We consider a Lagrangian for
scalar field in curved space-time with nonlinearity $\phi ^{4} $, which along
with the quadratic term $-\xi R\left|\phi \right|^{2} $ (where $\xi $ is the
interaction constant and $R$ is scalar curvature) contains a term $\sim \xi
R\left(\phi +\phi ^{+} \right)$ linear in $\phi $. Due to this term the
condition for the extrema of the potential energy of scalar field is given by a
cubic equation. Provided $\nu &gt; 1/3$ the scalar curvature $R=[\kappa (3\nu
-1)\varepsilon -4\Lambda ]$ (where $\kappa $ and $\Lambda $ are Einstein's
gravitational and cosmological constants) decreases along with decreasing
$\varepsilon $ in the process of the Universe's expansion, and at some critical
value $R_{c} &lt; 0$ a first-order phase transition occurs, induced by an
"external field" parameter proportional to $R$. Given certain conditions the
critical radius of the early Universe at the point of the first-order phase
transition may reach arbitrary large values, so this scenario of unrestricted
"inflation" of the Universe may be called "hyperinflation". Beyond the point of
phase transition the system is rolling down into the potential minimum with the
release of the potential energy of scalar field, accompanied by oscillations of
its amplitude $\phi $. The powerful heating of the Universe in the course of
attenuation of these oscillations plays the role of "Big Bang".
