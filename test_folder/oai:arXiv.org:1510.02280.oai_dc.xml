 <dc:title>Temperature Variation in the Dark Cosmic Fluid in the Late Universe</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A one-component dark energy fluid model of the late universe is considered
($w&lt;-1$) when the fluid, initially assumed laminar, makes a transition into a
turbulent state of motion. Spatial isotropy is assumed so that only the bulk
viscosities are included ($\zeta$ in the laminar epoch and $\zeta_{\rm turb}$
in the turbulent epoch). Both viscosities are assumed to be constants. We
derive a formula, new as far as we know, for the time dependence of the
temperature $T(t)$ in the laminar case when viscosity is included. Assuming
that the laminar/turbulent transition takes place at some time $t_s$ before the
big rip is reached, we then analyze the positive temperature jump experienced
by the fluid at $t=t_*$ if $\zeta_{\rm turb} &gt; \zeta$. This is just as one
would expect physically. The corresponding entropy production is also
considered. A special point emphasized in the paper is the analogy that exists
between the cosmic fluid and a so-called Maxwell fluid in viscoelasticity.
