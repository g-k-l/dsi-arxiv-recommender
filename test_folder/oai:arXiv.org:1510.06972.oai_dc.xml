 <dc:description>  Explicit high-order non-canonical symplectic particle-in-cell algorithms for
classical particle-field systems governed by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations are
developed. The algorithm conserves a discrete non-canonical symplectic
structure derived from the Lagrangian of the particle-field system, which is
naturally discrete in particles. The electromagnetic field is
spatially-discretized using the method of discrete exterior calculus with
high-order interpolating differential forms for a cubic grid. The resulting
time-domain Lagrangian assumes a non-canonical symplectic structure. It is also
gauge invariant and conserves charge. The system is then solved using a
splitting method discovered by He et al., which produces five exactly-soluable
sub-systems, and high-order structure- preserving algorithms follow by
combinations. The explicit, high-order, and conservative nature of the
algorithms is especially suitable for long-term simulations of particle-field
systems with extremely large number of degrees of freedom on massively parallel
supercomputers. The algorithms have been tested and verified by the two physics
problems, i.e., the nonlinear Landau damping and the electron Bernstein wave.
