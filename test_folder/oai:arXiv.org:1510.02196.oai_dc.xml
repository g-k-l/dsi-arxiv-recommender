 <dc:description>  Diabetes is an epidemic disease of the 21st century and is growing globally.
Although, final diabetes treatments and cure are still on research phase,
related complications of diabetes endanger life of diabetic patients. Diabetic
coma which happens with extreme high or low blood glucose is one of the risk
factor for diabetic patients and if it remains unattended will lead to patient
death or permanent brain damage. To reduce the risk of such deaths or damages,
a novel algorithm for wearable devices application, especially for smart
watches are proposed. Such application can inform the patients relatives or
emergency centers, if the person falls in coma or irresponsive condition based
on readouts from smart watches sensors including mobility, heart rate and skin
moisture. However; such an application is not a final solution to detect all
types of coma, but it potentially could save lives of many patients, if widely
used among the diabetic patients around the world.
