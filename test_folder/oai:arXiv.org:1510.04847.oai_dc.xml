 <dc:description>  We study transport of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric and
periodic one-dimensional potential, and subjected to both a symmetric, unbiased
external harmonic force as well as biased dichotomic noise $\eta(t)$ also known
as a random telegraph signal or a two state continuous-time Markov process. In
doing so, we concentrate on the previously reported regime [J. Spiechowicz et
al., Phys. Rev. E 90, 032104 (2014)] for which non-negative biased noise
$\eta(t)$ in the form of generalized white Poissonian noise can induce
anomalous transport processes similar to those generated by a deterministic
constant force $F=\langle \eta(t) \rangle $ but significantly more effective
than $F$, i.e. the particle moves much faster, the velocity fluctuations are
noticeable reduced and the transport efficiency is enhanced several times.
Here, we confirm this result for the case of dichotomous fluctuations which in
contrast to white Poissonian noise can assume positive as well as negative
values and examine the role of thermal noise in the observed phenomenon. We
focus our attention on the impact of bidirectionality of dichotomous
fluctuations and reveal that the effect of non-equilibrium noise enhanced
efficiency is still detectable. This result may explain transport phenomena
occurring in strongly fluctuating environments of both a physical and
biological origin. Our predictions can be corroborated experimentally by use of
a set-up that consists of a resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson
junction.
