 <dc:description>  The inner regions of the most massive compact stellar objects might be
occupied by a phase of quarks. Since the observations of the massive pulsars
PSR J1614-2230 and of PSR J0348+0432 with about two solar masses, the equations
of state constructing relativistic stellar models have to be constrained
respecting these new limits. We discuss stable hybrid stars, i.e. compact
objects with an outer layer composed of nuclear matter and with a core
consisting of quark matter (QM). For the outer nuclear layer we utilize a
density dependent nuclear equation of state and we use a chiral SU(3)
Quark-Meson model with a vacuum energy pressure to describe the objects core.
The appearance of a disconnected mass-radius branch emerging from the hybrid
star branch implies the existence of a third family of compact stars, so called
twin stars. Twin stars did not emerge as the transition pressure has to be
relatively small with a large jump in energy density, which could not be
satisfied within our approach. This is, among other reasons, due to the fact
that the speed of sound in QM has to be relatively high, which can be
accomplished by an increase of the repulsive coupling. This increase on the
other hand yields too high transition pressures for twins stars to appear.
