 <dc:description>  Empirical methods for connecting galaxies to their dark matter halos have
become essential in interpreting measurements of the spatial statistics of
galaxies. In this work, we present a novel approach for parameterizing the
degree of concentration dependence in the abundance matching method. This new
parameterization provides a smooth interpolation between two commonly used
matching proxies: the peak halo mass and the peak halo maximal circular
velocity. This parameterization controls the amount of dependence of galaxy
luminosity on halo concentration at a fixed halo mass. Effectively this
interpolation scheme enable abundance matching models to have adjustable
assembly bias in the resulting galaxy catalogs. With the new 400 Mpc/h DarkSky
Simulation, whose larger volume provides lower sample variance, we further show
that low-redshift two-point clustering and satellite fraction measurements from
SDSS can already provide a joint constraint on this concentration dependence
and the scatter within the abundance matching framework.
