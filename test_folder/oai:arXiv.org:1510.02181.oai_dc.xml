 <dc:description>  The first dual-port server-centric datacenter network, FiConn, was introduced
in 2009 and there are several others now in existence; however, the pool of
topologies to choose from remains small. We propose a new generic construction,
the stellar transformation, that dramatically increases the size of this pool
by facilitating the transformation of well-studied topologies from
interconnection networks, along with their networking properties and routing
algorithms, into viable dual-port server-centric datacenter network topologies.
We demonstrate that under our transformation, numerous interconnection networks
yield datacenter network topologies with potentially good, and easily
computable, baseline properties. We instantiate our construction so as to apply
it to generalized hypercubes and obtain the datacenter networks GQ*. Our
construction automatically yields routing algorithms for GQ* and we empirically
compare GQ* (and its routing algorithms) with the established datacenter
networks FiConn and DPillar (and their routing algorithms); this comparison is
with respect to network throughput, latency, load balancing, fault-tolerance,
and cost to build, and is with regard to all-to-all, many all-to-all,
butterfly, and random traffic patterns. We find that GQ* outperforms both
FiConn and DPillar (sometimes significantly so) and that there is substantial
scope for our stellar transformation to yield new dual-port server-centric
datacenter networks that are a considerable improvement on existing ones.
