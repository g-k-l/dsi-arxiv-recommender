 <dc:description>  I review a new rapidly growing area of high-energy plasma astrophysics ---
radiative magnetic reconnection, i.e., a reconnection regime where radiation
reaction influences reconnection dynamics, energetics, and nonthermal particle
acceleration. This influence be may be manifested via a number of
astrophysically important radiative effects, such as radiation-reaction limits
on particle acceleration, radiative cooling, radiative resistivity, braking of
reconnection outflows by radiation drag, radiation pressure, viscosity, and
even pair creation at highest energy densities. Self-consistent inclusion of
these effects in magnetic reconnection theory and modeling calls for serious
modifications to our overall theoretical approach to the problem. In addition,
prompt reconnection-powered radiation often represents our only observational
diagnostic tool for studying remote astrophysical systems; this underscores the
importance of developing predictive modeling capabilities to connect the
underlying physical conditions in a reconnecting system to observable radiative
signatures. This Chapter gives an overview of recent theoretical progress in
developing basic physical understanding of radiative reconnection, with a
special emphasis on astrophysically important radiation mechanisms like
synchrotron, curvature, and inverse-Compton. It also offers a broad review of
key high-energy astrophysical applications of radiative reconnection, such as:
pulsar wind nebulae and magnetospheres, accreting black-hole coronae and jets
in XRBs and AGN, magnetospheres of magnetars, and Gamma-Ray Bursts. Finally,
this Chapter discusses the most critical open questions and outlines the
directions for future research in this exciting new frontier of plasma
astrophysics.
