 <dc:description>  Time reversal symmetry (TRS) protects the metallic surface modes of
topological insulators (TIs). The transport signature of robust metallic
surface modes of TIs is a plateau that arrests the exponential divergence of
the insulating bulk with decreasing temperature. This universal behavior is
observed in all TI candidates ranging from Bi2Te2Se to SmB6. Recently, several
topological semimetals (TSMs) have been found that exhibit extreme
magnetoresistance (XMR) and TI universal resistivity behavior revealed only
when breaking TRS, a regime where TIs theoretically cease to exist. Among these
new materials, TaAs and NbP are nominated for Weyl semimetal due to their lack
of inversion symmetry, Cd3As2 is nominated for Dirac semimetal due to its
linear band crossing at the Fermi level, and WTe2 is nominated for resonant
compensated semimetal due to its perfect electron-hole symmetry. Here we
introduce LaSb, a simple rock-salt structure material without broken inversion
symmetry, without perfect linear band crossing, and without perfect
electron-hole symmetry. Yet LaSb portrays all the exotic field induced
behaviors of the aforementioned semimetals in an archetypal fashion. It shows
(a) the universal TI resistivity with a plateau at 15 K, revealed by a magnetic
field, (b) ultrahigh mobility of carriers in the plateau region, (c) quantum
oscillations with a non-trivial Berry phase, and (d) XMR of about one million
percent at 9 tesla rivaled only by WTe2 and NbP. Due to its dramatic
simplicity, LaSb is the ideal model system to formulate a theoretical
understanding of the exotic consequences of breaking TRS in TSMs.
