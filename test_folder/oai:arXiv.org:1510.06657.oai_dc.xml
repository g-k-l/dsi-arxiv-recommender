 <dc:description>  We discuss charged lepton flavour violating processes occurring in the
presence of muonic atoms, such as muon-electron conversion in nuclei
$\text{CR}(\mu -e, \text{ N})$, the (Coulomb enhanced) decay of muonic atoms
into a pair of electrons BR($\mu^- e^- \to e^- e^-$, N), as well as Muonium
conversion and decay, $\text{Mu}-\bar{\text{Mu}}$ and $\text{Mu}\to e^+ e^-$.
Any experimental signal of these observables calls for scenarios of physics
beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we consider minimal extensions of the
Standard Model via the addition of sterile fermions, providing the
corresponding complete analytical expressions for all the considered
observables. We first consider an "ad hoc" extension with a single sterile
fermion state, and investigate its impact on the above observables. Two well
motivated mechanisms of neutrino mass generation are then considered: the
Inverse Seesaw embedded into the Standard Model, and the $\nu$MSM. Our study
reveals that, depending on their mass range and on the active-sterile mixing
angles, sterile neutrinos can give significant contributions to the above
mentioned observables, some of them even lying within present and future
sensitivity of dedicated cLFV experiments. We complete the analysis by
confronting our results to other (direct and indirect) searches for sterile
fermions.
