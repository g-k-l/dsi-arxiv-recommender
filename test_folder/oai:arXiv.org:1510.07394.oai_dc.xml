 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the capacity of the Gaussian two-hop
full-duplex (FD) relay channel with self-interference. This channel is
comprised of a source, an FD relay, and a destination, where a direct
source-destination link does not exist and the FD relay is impaired by
self-interference. We model the self-interference as an additive Gaussian
random variable whose variance is proportional to the amplitude of the transmit
symbol at the relay. For this channel, we derive the capacity and propose an
explicit capacity-achieving coding scheme. Thereby, we show that the optimal
input distribution at the source is Gaussian and its variance depends on the
amplitude of the transmit symbol at the relay. On the other hand, the optimal
input distribution at the relay is discrete or Gaussian, where the latter case
occurs only when the relay-destination link is the bottleneck link. The derived
capacity converges to the capacity of the two-hop ideal FD relay channel
without self-interference and to the capacity of the two-hop half-duplex (HD)
relay channel in the limiting cases when the self-interference is zero and
infinite, respectively. Our numerical results show that significant performance
gains are achieved using the proposed capacity-achieving coding scheme compared
to the achievable rates of conventional FD relaying and HD relaying.
