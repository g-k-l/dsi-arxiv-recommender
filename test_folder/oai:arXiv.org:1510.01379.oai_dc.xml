 <dc:description>  The controlled transfer of particles from one site of a spatial lattice to
another is essential for many tasks in quantum information processing and
quantum communication. Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots and ultracold atoms
held in optical lattices, provide two means of studying coherent quantum
transport in well-controlled systems. In this work we study how to induce
long-range transfer between the two ends of a dimer chain, by coupling states
that are localized just on the chain's end-points. This has the appealing
feature that the transfer occurs only between the end-points -- the particle
does not pass through the intermediate sites -- making the transfer less
susceptible to decoherence. We first show how a repulsively bound-pair of
fermions, known as a doublon, can be transferred from one end of the chain to
the other via topological edge states. We then show how non-topological surface
states of the familiar Shockley or Tamm type can be used to produce a similar
form of transfer under the action of a periodic driving potential. Finally we
show that combining these effects can produce transfer by means of more exotic
topological effects, in which the driving field can be used to switch the
topological character of the edge states, as measured by the Zak phase. Our
results demonstrate how to induce long range transfer of strongly correlated
particles by tuning both topology and driving.
