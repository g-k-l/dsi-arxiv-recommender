 <dc:description>  Traditional fact checking by experts and analysts cannot keep pace with the
volume of newly created information. It is important and necessary, therefore,
to enhance our ability to computationally determine whether some statement of
fact is true or false. We view this problem as a link-prediction task in a
knowledge graph, and present a discriminative path-based method for fact
checking in knowledge graphs that incorporates connectivity, type information,
and predicate interactions. Given a statement S of the form (subject,
predicate, object), for example, (Chicago, capitalOf, Illinois), our approach
mines discriminative paths that alternatively define the generalized statement
(U.S. city, predicate, U.S. state) and uses the mined rules to evaluate the
veracity of statement S. We evaluate our approach by examining thousands of
claims related to history, geography, biology, and politics using a public,
million node knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia and PubMedDB. Not only
does our approach significantly outperform related models, we also find that
the discriminative predicate path model is easily interpretable and provides
sensible reasons for the final determination.
