 <dc:description>  The stratification of the Grassmannian by positroid varieties has been the
subject of extensive research. Positroid varieties are in bijection with a
number of combinatorial objects, including $k$-Bruhat intervals and bounded
affine permutations. In addition, Postnikov's boundary measurement map gives a
family of parametrizations of each positroid variety; the domain of each
parametrization is the space of edge weights of a weighted planar network. In
this paper, we generalize the combinatorics of positroid varieties to the
Lagrangian Grassmannian $\Lambda(2n)$, which is the type $C$ analog of the
ordinary, or type $A$, Grassmannian. The Lagrangian Grassmannian has a
stratification by projected Richardson varieties, which are the type $C$
analogs of positroid varieties. We define type $C$ generalizations of bounded
affine permutations and $k$-Bruhat intervals, as well as several other
combinatorial posets which index positroid varieties. In addition, we
generalize Postnikov's network parametrizations to projected Richardson
varieties in $\Lambda(2n)$. In particular, we show that restricting the edge
weights of our networks to $\mathbb{R}^+$ yields a family of parametrizations
for totally nonnegative cells in $\Lambda(2n)$. In the process, we obtain a set
of linear relations among the Pl\"ucker coordinates on $\text{Gr}(n,2n)$ which
cut out the Lagrangian Grassmannian set-theoretically.
