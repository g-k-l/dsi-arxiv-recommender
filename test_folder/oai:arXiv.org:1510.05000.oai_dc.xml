 <dc:description>  We present 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) modeling of an ultra-intense laser
experiment by the Extreme Light group at the Air Force Research Laboratory
(AFRL) using the PIC code LSP. This is the first time PIC simulations have been
performed in 3D for this experiment which involves an ultra-intense,
short-pulse (30 fs) laser interacting with a water jet target at normal
incidence. These 3D PIC simulation results are compared to results from
2D(3$v$) PIC simulations for both $5.4~\cdot~10^{17}$ W cm$^{-2}$ and
$3~\cdot~10^{17}$ W cm$^{-2}$ intensities. Comparing the 2D(3$v$) and 3D
simulation results, the laser-energy-to-ejected-electron-energy conversion
efficiencies were comparable, but the angular distribution of ejected electrons
show interesting differences with qualitative differences at higher intensity.
An analytic plane-wave model is discussed which provides some explanation for
the angular distribution and energies of ejected electrons in the 2D(3$v$)
simulations. We also performed a 3D simulation with circularly polarized light
and found a significantly higher conversion efficiency and peak electron
energy, which is promising for future experiments.
