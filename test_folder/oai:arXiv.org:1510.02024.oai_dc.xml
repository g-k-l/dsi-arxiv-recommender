 <dc:description>  Recently, it has been shown by S.~M. de Carvalho et al. (2014) that the
deviations between the degenerate case and observations were already evident
for 0.7-0.8 M$_{\odot}$ white dwarfs. Such deviations were related to the
neglected effects of finite temperatures on the structure of a white dwarf.
Therefore, in this work by employing the Chandrasekhar equation of state taking
into account the effects of temperature we show how the total pressure of the
white dwarf matter depends on the mass density at different temperatures.
Afterwards we construct equilibrium configurations of white dwarfs at finite
temperatures. We obtain the mass-radius relations of white dwarfs for different
temperatures by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, and compare
them with the estimated masses and radii inferred from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 4.
