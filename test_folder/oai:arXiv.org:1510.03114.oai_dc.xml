 <dc:description>  The non-observation of new particles at the LHC suggests the existence of a
mass gap above the electroweak scale. This situation is adequately described
through a general electroweak effective theory with the established fields and
Standard Model symmetries. Its couplings contain all information about the
unknown short-distance dynamics which is accessible at low energies. We
consider a generic strongly-coupled scenario of electroweak symmetry breaking,
with heavy states above the gap, and analyze the imprints that its lightest
bosonic excitations leave on the effective Lagrangian couplings. Different
quantum numbers of the heavy states imply different patterns of low-energy
couplings, with characteristic correlations which could be identified in future
data samples. The predictions can be sharpened with mild assumptions about the
ultraviolet behaviour of the underlying fundamental theory.
