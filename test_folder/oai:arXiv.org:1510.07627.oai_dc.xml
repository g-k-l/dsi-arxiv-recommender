 <dc:description>  We examine interacting Abelian theories at low energies and show that
holomorphically normalized photon helicity amplitudes transform into dual
amplitudes under SL(2,Z) as modular forms with weights that depend on the
number of positive and negative helicity photons and on the number of internal
photon lines. Moreover, canonically normalized helicity amplitudes transform by
a phase, so that even though the amplitudes are not duality invariant, their
squares are duality invariant. We explicitly verify the duality transformation
at one loop by comparing the amplitudes in the case of an electron and the dyon
that is its SL(2,Z) image, and extend the invariance of squared amplitudes
order by order in perturbation theory. We demonstrate that S-duality is
property of all low-energy effective Abelian theories with electric and/or
magnetic charges and see how the duality generically breaks down at high
energies.
