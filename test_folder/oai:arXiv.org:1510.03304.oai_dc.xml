 <dc:description>  We construct a Goodwillie tower of categories which interpolates between the
category of pointed spaces and the category of spectra. This tower of
categories refines the Goodwillie tower of the identity functor in a precise
sense. More generally, we construct such a tower for a large class of
infinity-categories C. We classify such Goodwillie towers in terms of the
derivatives of the identity functor of C. This classification becomes very
simple in settings where the Tate cohomology of the symmetric groups vanishes.
As an example we apply our methods to rational homotopy theory. Another
application identifies the homotopy theory of p-local spaces with homotopy
groups in a certain finite range with the homotopy theory of certain algebras
over Ching's spectral version of the Lie operad. This is a close analogue of
Quillen's results on rational homotopy. In the sequel to this paper we will
work out consequences for the study of $v_n$-periodic unstable homotopy theory
and the Bousfield-Kuhn functors.
