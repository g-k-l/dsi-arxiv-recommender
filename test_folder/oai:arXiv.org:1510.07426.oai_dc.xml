 <dc:description>  The method to calculate the grand partition function of a particle system, in
which constituents interact with each other via potential, that include
repulsive and attractive components, is proposed. The cell model, which was
introduced to describe critical phenomena and phase transitions, is used to
provide calculations. The exact procedure of integration over particle
coordinates and summation over number of particles is proposed. As a result, an
evident expression for the grand partition function of the fluid cell model is
obtained in the form of multiple integral over collective variables. As it can
be seen directly from the structure of the transition jacobian, the present
multiparticle model appeared to be different from the Ising model, which is
widely used to describe fluid systems. The state equation, which is valid for
wide temperature ranges both above and below the critical one, is derived in
mean-field approximation. The pressure calculated for the cell model at
temperatures above the critical one is found to be continuously increasing
function of temperature and density. The isotherms of pressure as a function of
density have horizontal parts at temperatures below the critical one.
