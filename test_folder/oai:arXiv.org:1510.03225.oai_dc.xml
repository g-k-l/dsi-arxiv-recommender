 <dc:description>  Verification bias is a well-known problem that may occur in the evaluation of
predictive ability of diagnostic tests. When a binary disease status is
considered, various solutions can be found in the literature to correct
inference based on usual measures of test accuracy, such as the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve or the area underneath. Evaluation of the
predictive ability of continuous diagnostic tests in the presence of
verification bias for a three-class disease status is here discussed. In
particular, several verification bias-corrected estimators of the ROC surface
and of the volume underneath are proposed. Consistency and asymptotic normality
of the proposed estimators are established and their finite sample behavior is
investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulation studies. Two illustrations are
also given.
