 <dc:description>  In the framework of kt-factorization approach,the production of prompt
$\chi_c$ mesons in pp collisions at the LHC energies is studied. Our
consideration is based on the off-shell amplitudes for hard partonic
subprocesses $g^*g^*\to\chi_{cJ}$ and non-relativistic QCD formalism for bound
states. The transverse momentum dependent (unintegrated) gluon densities in a
proton were derived from Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini evolution equation
or, alternatively, were chosen in accordance with Kimber-Martin-Ryskin
prescription. Taking into account both color singlet and color octet
contributions, we deduce the corresponding non-perturbative long-distance
matrix elements from the fits to the latest ATLAS data on $\chi_{c1}$ and
$\chi_{c2}$ transverse momentum distributions at $\sqrt s = 7$ TeV. We find
that these distributions at small and moderate pt are formed mainly by the
color singlet components. We successfully described the data on the
differential cross sections and relative production rates
$\sigma(\chi_{c2})/\sigma(\chi_{c1})$ presented by the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb
Collaborations. We find that the fit points to unequal wave functions of
$\chi_{c1}$ and $\chi_{c2}$ states.
