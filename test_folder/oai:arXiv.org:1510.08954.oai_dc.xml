 <dc:description>  Collective organization in matter plays a significant role in its expressed
physical properties. Typically, it is detected via an order parameter,
appropriately defined for each given system's observed emergent patterns.
Recent developments in information theory, however, suggest quantifying
collective organization in a system- and phenomenon-agnostic way: decompose the
system's thermodynamic entropy density into a localized entropy, that solely
contained in the dynamics at a single location, and a bound entropy, that
stored in space as domains, clusters, excitations, or other emergent
structures. We compute this decomposition and related quantities explicitly for
the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the 1D chain, the Bethe lattice with
coordination number k=3, and the 2D square lattice, illustrating its generality
and the functional insights it gives near and away from phase transitions. In
particular, we consider the roles that different spin motifs play (in cluster
bulk, cluster edges, and the like) and how these affect the dependencies
between spins.
