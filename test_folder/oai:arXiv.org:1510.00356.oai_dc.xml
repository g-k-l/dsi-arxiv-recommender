 <dc:description>  We present an example of two countable $\omega$-categorical structures, one
of which has a finite relational language, whose endomorphism monoids are
isomorphic as abstract monoids, but not as topological monoids -- in other
words, no isomorphism between these monoids is a homeomorphism. For the same
two structures, the automorphism groups and polymorphism clones are isomorphic,
but not topologically isomorphic. In particular, there exists a countable
$\omega$-categorical structure in a finite relational language which can
neither be reconstructed up to first-order bi-interpretations from its
automorphism group, nor up to existential positive bi-interpretations from its
endomorphism monoid, nor up to primitive positive bi-interpretations from its
polymorphism clone.
