 <dc:description>  Theoretical spectroscopy is a powerful tool to describe and predict optical
properties of materials. While nowadays routinely performed, first-principles
calculations only provide bulk dielectric tensors in Cartesian coordinates.
These outputs are hardly comparable with experimental data, which are typically
given by macroscopic quantities, crucially depending on the laboratory setup.
Even more serious discrepancies can arise for anisotropic materials, e.g.,
organic crystals, where off-diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor can
significantly contribute to the spectral features. Here, we present
LayerOptics, a versatile and user-friendly implementation, based on the
solution of the Maxwell's equations for anisotropic materials, to compute
optical coefficients in anisotropic layered materials. We apply this tool for
post-processing full dielectric tensors of molecular materials, including
excitonic effects, as computed from many-body perturbation theory using the
exciting code. For prototypical examples, ranging from optical to X-ray
frequencies, we show the importance of combining accurate ab initio methods to
obtain dielectric tensors, with the solution of the Maxwell's equations to
compute optical coefficients accounting for optical anisotropy of layered
systems. Good agreement with experimental data supports the potential of our
approach, in view of achieving microscopic understanding of spectroscopic
properties in complex materials.
