 <dc:description>  We report measurements from which we determine the spatial structure of the
lunar contribution to night sky brightness, taken at the LSST site on Cerro
Pachon in Chile. We use an array of six photodiodes with filters that
approximate the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope's {\it u, g, r, i, z,} and {\it
y} bands. We use the sun as a proxy for the moon, and measure sky brightness as
a function of zenith angle of the point on sky, zenith angle of the sun, and
angular distance between the sun and the point on sky. We make a correction for
the difference between the illumination spectrum of the sun and the moon. Since
scattered sunlight totally dominates the daytime sky brightness, this technique
allows us to cleanly determine the contribution to the (cloudless) night sky
from backscattered moonlight, without contamination from other sources of night
sky brightness. We estimate our uncertainty in the relative lunar night sky
brightness vs. zenith and lunar angle to be 10\,\%. This information is useful
in planning the optimal execution of the LSST survey, and perhaps for other
astronomical observations as well. Although our primary objective is to map out
the angular structure and spectrum of the scattered light from the atmosphere
and particulates, we also make an estimate of the expected number of scattered
lunar photons per pixel per second in LSST, and find values that are in overall
agreement with previous estimates.
