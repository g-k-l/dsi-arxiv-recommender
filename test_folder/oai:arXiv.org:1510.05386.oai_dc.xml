 <dc:description>  Covering matrices were introduced by Viale in his proof that the Singular
Cardinals Hypothesis follows from the Proper Forcing Axiom. In the course of
his work and in subsequent work with Sharon, he isolated two reflection
principles, $\mathrm{CP}$ and $\mathrm{S}$, which may hold of covering
matrices. In this paper, we continue previous work of the author investigating
connections between failures of $\mathrm{CP}$ and $\mathrm{S}$ and variations
on Jensen's square principle. We prove that, for a regular cardinal $\lambda &gt;
\omega_1$, assuming large cardinals, $\square(\lambda, 2)$ is consistent with
$\mathrm{CP}(\lambda, \theta)$ for all $\theta$ with $\theta^+ &lt; \lambda$. We
demonstrate how to force nice $\theta$-covering matrices for $\lambda$ which
fail to satisfy $\mathrm{CP}$ and $\mathrm{S}$. We investigate normal covering
matrices, showing that, for a regular uncountable $\kappa$, $\square_\kappa$
implies the existence of a normal $\omega$-covering matrix for $\kappa^+$ but
that cardinal arithmetic imposes limits on the existence of a normal
$\theta$-covering matrix for $\kappa^+$ when $\theta$ is uncountable. We also
investigate certain increasing sequences of functions which arise from covering
matrices and from PCF-theoretic considerations and show that a stationary
reflection hypothesis places limits on the behavior of these sequences.
