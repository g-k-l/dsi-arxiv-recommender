 <dc:description>  The eigenvector centrality equation $\lambda x = A \, x$ is a successful
compromise between simplicity and expressivity. It claims that central actors
are those connected with central others. For at least 70 years, this equation
has been explored in disparate contexts, including econometrics, sociometry,
bibliometrics, Web information retrieval, and network science. We propose an
equally elegant counterpart: the power equation $x = A x^{\div}$, where
$x^{\div}$ is the vector whose entries are the reciprocal of those of $x$. It
asserts that power is in the hands of those connected with powerless others. It
is meaningful, for instance, in bargaining situations, where it is advantageous
to be connected to those who have few options. We tell the parallel, mostly
unexplored story of this intriguing equation.
