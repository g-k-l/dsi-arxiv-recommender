 <dc:description>  We develop a long-term 1-D evolution model for icy satellites that couples
multiple processes: water migration and differentiation, geochemical reactions
and silicate phase transitions, compaction by self-gravity, and ablation. The
model further considers the following energy sources and sinks: tidal heating,
radiogenic heating, geochemical energy released by serpentinization or absorbed
by mineral dehydration, gravitational energy and insolation, and heat transport
by conduction, convection, and advection. We apply the model to Enceladus, by
guessing the initial conditions that would render a structure compatible with
present-day observations, assuming the initial structure to have been
homogeneous. Assuming the satellite has been losing water continually along its
evolution, we postulate that it was formed as a more massive, more icy and more
porous satellite, and gradually transformed into its present day state due to
sustained long-term tidal heating. We consider several initial compositions and
evolution scenarios and follow the evolution for the age of the Solar System,
testing the present day model results against the available observational
constraints. Our model shows the present configuration to be differentiated
into a pure icy mantle, several tens of km thick, overlying a rocky core,
composed of dehydrated rock at the center and hydrated rock in the outer part.
For Enceladus, it predicts a higher rock/ice mass ratio than previously assumed
and a thinner ice mantle, compatible with recent estimates based on gravity
field measurements. Although, obviously, the model cannot be used to explain
local phenomena, it sheds light on the internal structure invoked in
explanations of localized features and activities.
