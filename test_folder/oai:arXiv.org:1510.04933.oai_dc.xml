 <dc:description>  We investigate through non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations the
structure and flow of fluids in functionalized nanopores. The nanopores are
modeled as cylindrical structures with solvophilic and solvophobic sites. Two
fluids are modeled. The first is a standard Lennard Jones fluid. The second one
is modeled with a isotropic two-length scale potential, which exhibits in bulk
water-like anomalies. Our results indicates distinct dependence of the overall
mass flux for each species of fluid with the number of solvophilic sites for
different nanotubes radii. Also, the density and fluid structure are dependent
from the nanotube radius and the solvophilic properties of the nanotube. This
indicates that the presence of a second length scale in the fluid-fluid
interaction will lead to distinct behavior. Also, our results shows that
chemically functionalized nanotubes with different radius will have distinct
nano-fluidic features. Our results are explained in the basis of the
characteristic scale fluid properties and the effects of nanoconfinement.
