 <dc:description>  We construct simple solutions of three-dimensional higher spin gravity
interacting with matter in which only the scalar and spin-two fields are
excited. They preserve Lorentz symmetry and are similar to the four-dimensional
solutions constructed by Sezgin and Sundell, with the difference that the
additional twisted sectors of the three-dimensional theory are excited.
Furthermore, the three-dimensional system contains an extra parameter $\lambda$
which allows us to vary the mass of the scalar. Among other reasons, the
resulting solutions are interesting for the holographic study of cosmological
singularities: they describe the growth of a Coleman-De Luccia bubble in
anti-de Sitter space, ending in a big crunch singularity. We initiate the
holographic study of these solutions, finding evidence for their interpretation
within a multi-trace deformation which renders the dual field theory unstable.
The limit $\lambda \to 0$ is particularly interesting as it captures effects of
a running coupling in a large-$N$ interacting fermion model. We also propose a
generalization of our solutions, consisting of a dressing with
Lorentz-invariant projectors. This additional sector remains non-trivial when
the scalar field is turned off.
