 <dc:description>  A thermal convection loop is a annular chamber filled with water, heated on
the bottom half and cooled on the top half. With sufficiently large forcing of
heat, the direction of fluid flow in the loop oscillates chaotically, dynamics
analogous to the Earth's weather. As is the case for state-of-the-art weather
models, we only observe the statistics over a small region of state space,
making prediction difficult. To overcome this challenge, data assimilation (DA)
methods, and specifically ensemble methods, use the computational model itself
to estimate the uncertainty of the model to optimally combine these
observations into an initial condition for predicting the future state. Here,
we build and verify four distinct DA methods, and then, we perform a twin model
experiment with the computational fluid dynamics simulation of the loop using
the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) to assimilate observations and
predict flow reversals. We show that using adaptively shaped localized
covariance outperforms static localized covariance with the ETKF, and allows
for the use of less observations in predicting flow reversals. We also show
that a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) of the temperature and velocity fields
recovers the low dimensional system underlying reversals, finding specific
modes which together are predictive of reversal direction.
