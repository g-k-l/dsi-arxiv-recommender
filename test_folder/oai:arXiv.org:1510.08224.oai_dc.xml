 <dc:description>  In this paper, a non-orthogonal multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice
Boltzmann (LB) method for simulating incompressible thermal flows is presented.
In the method, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and temperature
equation are solved separately by two different MRT-LB equations, which are
developed based on non-orthogonal basis vectors obtained from the combinations
of the lattice velocity components. The macroscopic governing equations of
incompressible thermal flows can be recovered from the method through the
Chapman-Enskog analysis in the incompressible limit. Numerical simulations of
several typical two-dimensional problems are carried out to validate the
proposed method. It is found that the present results are in good agreement
with the analytical solutions and/or other numerical results reported in the
literature. Furthermore, the non-orthogonal MRT-LB model shows better numerical
stability in comparison with the BGK-LB model, and the grid convergence tests
indicate that the present MRT-LB method has a second-order convergence rate in
space.
