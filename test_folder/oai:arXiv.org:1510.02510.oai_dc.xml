 <dc:description>  Genetic interactions confer robustness on cells in response to genetic
perturbations. This often occurs through molecular buffering mechanisms that
can be predicted using, among other features, the degree of coexpression
between genes, commonly estimated through marginal measures of association such
as Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients. However, marginal correlations
are sensitive to indirect effects and often partial correlations are used
instead. Yet, partial correlations convey no information about the (linear)
influence of the coexpressed genes on the entire multivariate system, which may
be crucial to discriminate functional associations from genetic interactions.
To address these two shortcomings, here we propose to use the edge weight
derived from the covariance decomposition over the paths of the associated gene
network. We call this new quantity the networked partial correlation and use it
to analyze genetic interactions in yeast.
