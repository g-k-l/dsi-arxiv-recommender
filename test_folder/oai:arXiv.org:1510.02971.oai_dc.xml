 <dc:description>  Given a probability measure $\mu$ supported on a convex subset $\Omega$ of
Euclidean space $(\mathbb{R}^d,g_0)$, we are interested in obtaining Poincar\'e
and log-Sobolev type inequalities on $(\Omega,g_0,\mu)$. To this end, we change
the metric $g_0$ to a more general Riemannian one $g$, adapted in a certain
sense to $\mu$, and perform our analysis on $(\Omega,g,\mu)$. The types of
metrics we consider are Hessian metrics (intimately related to associated
optimal-transport problems), product metrics (which are very useful when $\mu$
is unconditional, i.e. invariant under reflection with respect to the principle
hyperplanes), and metrics conformal to the Euclidean one, which have not been
previously explored in this context. Invoking on $(\Omega,g,\mu)$ tools such as
Riemannian generalizations of the Brascamp--Lieb inequality and the
Bakry--\'Emery criterion, and passing back to the original Euclidean metric, we
obtain various weighted inequalities on $(\Omega,g_0,\mu)$: refined and
entropic versions of the Brascamp--Lieb inequality, weighted Poincar\'e and
log-Sobolev inequalities, Hardy-type inequalities, etc. Key to our analysis is
the positivity of the associated Lichnerowicz--Bakry--\'Emery generalized Ricci
curvature tensor, and the convexity of the manifold $(\Omega,g,\mu)$. In some
cases, we can only ensure that the latter manifold is (generalized)
mean-convex, resulting in additional boundary terms in our inequalities.
