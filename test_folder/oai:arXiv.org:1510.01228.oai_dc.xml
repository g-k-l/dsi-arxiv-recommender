 <dc:description>  A natural modification of the equations of covariantly-constant vector fields
(CCVF) in Weyl geometry leads us to consider a metric compatible geometry
possessing conformal curvature and torsion fully determined by its trace. The
latter is interpreted as a form of the electromagnetic (EM) 4-potentials and,
on a fixed metric background, turns out to be fully determined by the CCVF
equations. When the metric is set Minkowskian, the named equations possess two
topologically distinct solutions, with the associated EM fields being
asymptotically of the Lienard-Wiechert type and having distributed sources,
with a fixed (``elementary'') value of the electric charge. One of the
solutions is everywhere regular, whereas the other - singular on a
2-dimensional shell. The speed of propagation of EM fields depends on the local
charge density and only asymptotically approaches the speed of light
