 <dc:description>  The gravitational collapse of massive stars serves to manifest the most
severe deviations of general relativity with respect to Newtonian gravity: the
formation of horizons and spacetime singularities. Both features have proven to
be catalysts of deep physical developments, especially when combined with the
principles of quantum mechanics. Nonetheless, it is seldom remarked that it is
hardly possible to combine all these developments into a unified theoretical
model, while maintaining reasonable prospects for the independent experimental
corroboration of its different parts. In this paper we review the current
theoretical understanding of the physics of gravitational collapse in order to
highlight this tension, stating the position that the standard view on
evaporating black holes stands for. This serves as the motivation for the
discussion of a recent proposal that offers the opposite perspective,
represented by a set of geometries that regularize the classical singular
behavior and present modifications of the near-horizon Schwarzschild geometry
as the result of the propagation of non-perturbative ultraviolet effects
originated in regions of high curvature. We present an extensive exploration of
the necessary steps on the explicit construction of these geometries, and
discuss how this proposal could change our present understanding of
astrophysical black holes and even offer the possibility of detecting genuine
ultraviolet effects on future gravitational wave experiments.
