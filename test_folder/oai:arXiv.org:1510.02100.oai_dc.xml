 <dc:description>  We propose an efficient grassmannian formalism for solution of bi-linear
finite-difference Hirota equation (T-system) on T-shaped lattices related to
the space of highest weight representations of $gl(K_1,K_2|M)$ superalgebra.
The formalism is inspired by the quantum fusion procedure known from the
integrable spin chains and is based on exterior forms of Baxter-like
Q-functions. We find a few new interesting relations among the exterior forms
of Q-functions and reproduce, using our new formalism, the Wronskian
determinant solutions of Hirota equations known in the literature. Then we
generalize this construction to the twisted Q-functions and demonstrate the
subtleties of untwisting procedure on the examples of rational quantum spin
chains with twisted boundary conditions. Using these observations, we
generalize the recently discovered, in our paper with N. Gromov, AdS/CFT
Quantum Spectral Curve for exact planar spectrum of AdS/CFT duality to the case
of arbitrary Cartan twisting of AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ string sigma model. Finally,
we successfully probe this formalism by reproducing the energy of gamma-twisted
BMN vacuum at single-wrapping orders of weak coupling expansion.
