 <dc:description>  This paper puts forward a conjecture that there are no black holes in M
theory. We will show that a mechanism to prevent black hole formation is needed
in 4 dimensions to make string theory a viable high energy model of quantum
gravity. Black hole formation may be averted by a gravity regulation mechanism
based on string condensation. In this scenario, black holes are replaced by
`hot holograms' that form during gravitational collapse. The geometric
conditions based on the properties of free thermalon solutions that are
proposed for conversion to a high temperature hologram to occur, however, are
local and generic in dimension and could apply throughout M space. This idea
can be applied to resolve the problems presented by the process of black hole
evaporation, which appears to be inconsistent with quantum information theory.
Whereas, in the conventional view, black holes are real and firewalls are
probably a chimera, in the scenario proposed here that situation would be
reversed.
