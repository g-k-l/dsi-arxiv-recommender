 <dc:description>  Quantum pseudo-telepathy games are good examples of explaining the
strangeness of quantum mechanics and demonstrating the advantage of quantum
resources over classical resources. Most of the quantum pseudo-telepathy games
are common interest games, nevertheless conflicting interest games are more
widely used to model real world situations. Recently Pappa et al. (Phys. Rev.
Lett. 114, 020401, 2015) proposed the first two-party conflicting interest game
where quantum advice enhances social optimality. In the present paper we give
two new three-party conflicting interest games and show that quantum advice can
enhance social optimality in a three-party setting. The first game we propose
is based on the famous GHZ game which is a common interest game. The second
game we propose is related to the Svetlichny inequality which demonstrates
quantum mechanics cannot be explained by the local hidden variable model in a
three-party setting.
