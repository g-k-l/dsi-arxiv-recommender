 <dc:description>  Reliable quantum information processing requires high fidelity universal
manipulation of quantum systems within the characteristic coherence times.
Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation offers a promising approach to
implement fast, universal, and robust quantum logic gates particularly useful
in nano-fabricated solid-state architectures, which typically have short
coherence times. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to realize
high-speed universal geometric quantum gates in nano-engineered pseudo-spin
charge qubits. We use a system of three coupled quantum dots containing a
single electron, where two computational states of a double quantum-dot charge
qubit interact through an intermediate quantum dot. The additional degree of
freedom introduced into the qubit makes it possible to create a geometric model
system, which allows robust and efficient single-qubit rotations through
careful control of the inter-dot tunneling parameters. We demonstrate that a
capacitive coupling between two charge qubits permits a family of non-adiabatic
holonomic controlled two-qubit entangling gates, and thus provides a promising
procedure to maintain entanglement in charge qubits and a pathway toward
fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. We estimate the feasibility of
the proposed structure by analyzing the gate fidelities to some extent.
