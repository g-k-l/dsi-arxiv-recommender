 <dc:description>  Two-locus sampling probabilities have played a central role in devising an
efficient composite likelihood method for estimating fine-scale recombination
rates. Due to mathematical and computational challenges, these sampling
probabilities are typically computed under the unrealistic assumption of a
constant population size, and simulation studies have shown that resulting
recombination rate estimates can be severely biased in certain cases of
historical population size changes. To alleviate this problem, we develop here
new methods to compute the sampling probability for variable population size
functions that are piecewise constant. Our main theoretical result, implemented
in a new software package called LDpop, is a novel formula for the sampling
probability that can be evaluated by numerically exponentiating a large but
sparse matrix. This formula can handle moderate sample sizes ($n \leq 50$) and
demographic size histories with a large number of epochs ($\mathcal{D} \geq
64$). In addition, LDpop implements an approximate formula for the sampling
probability that is reasonably accurate and scales to hundreds in sample size
($n \geq 256$). Finally, LDpop includes an importance sampler for the posterior
distribution of two-locus genealogies, based on a new result for the optimal
proposal distribution in the variable-size setting. Using our methods, we study
how a sharp population bottleneck followed by rapid growth affects the
correlation between partially linked sites. Then, through an extensive
simulation study, we show that accounting for population size changes under
such a demographic model leads to substantial improvements in fine-scale
recombination rate estimation. LDpop is freely available for download at
