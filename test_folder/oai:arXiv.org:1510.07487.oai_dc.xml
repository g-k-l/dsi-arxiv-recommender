 <dc:description>  Multiple binomial sums form a large class of multi-indexed sequences, closed
under partial summation, which contains most of the sequences obtained by
multiple summation of products of binomial coefficients and also all the
sequences with algebraic generating function. We study the representation of
the generating functions of binomial sums by integrals of rational functions.
The outcome is twofold. Firstly, we show that a univariate sequence is a
multiple binomial sum if and only if its generating function is the diagonal of
a rational function. Secondly, we propose algorithms that decide the equality
of multiple binomial sums and that compute recurrence relations for them. In
conjunction with geometric simplifications of the integral representations,
this approach behaves well in practice. The process avoids the computation of
certificates and the problem of the appearance of spurious singularities that
afflicts discrete creative telescoping, both in theory and in practice.
