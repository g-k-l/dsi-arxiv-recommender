 <dc:description>  We present a model for multi-wavelength mixing in semiconductor optical
amplifiers (SOAs) based on coupled-mode equations. The proposed model applies
to all kinds of SOA structures, takes into account the longitudinal dependence
of carrier density caused by saturation, it accommodates an arbitrary
functional dependencies of the material gain and carrier recombination rate on
the local value of carrier density, and is computationally more efficient by
orders of magnitude as compared with the standard full model based on
space-time equations. We apply the coupled-mode equations model to a recently
demonstrated phase-sensitive amplifier based on an integrated SOA and prove its
results to be consistent with the experimental data. The accuracy of the
proposed model is certified by means of a meticulous comparison with the
results obtained by integrating the space-time equations.
