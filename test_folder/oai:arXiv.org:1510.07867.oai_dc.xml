 <dc:description>  For people first impressions of someone are of determining importance. They
are hard to alter through further information. This begs the question if a
computer can reach the same judgement. Earlier research has already pointed out
that age, gender, and average attractiveness can be estimated with reasonable
precision. We improve the state-of-the-art, but also predict - based on
someone's known preferences - how much that particular person is attracted to a
novel face. Our computational pipeline comprises a face detector, convolutional
neural networks for the extraction of deep features, standard support vector
regression for gender, age and facial beauty, and - as the main novelties -
visual regularized collaborative filtering to infer inter-person preferences as
well as a novel regression technique for handling visual queries without rating
history. We validate the method using a very large dataset from a dating site
as well as images from celebrities. Our experiments yield convincing results,
i.e. we predict 76% of the ratings correctly solely based on an image, and
reveal some sociologically relevant conclusions. We also validate our
collaborative filtering solution on the standard MovieLens rating dataset,
augmented with movie posters, to predict an individual's movie rating. We
demonstrate our algorithms on howhot.io which went viral around the Internet
with more than 50 million pictures evaluated in the first month.
