  Embeddable in a Free Lattice</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This article is part of my upcoming masters thesis which investigates the
following open problem from the book, Free Lattices, by R.Freese, J.Jezek, and
J.B. Nation published in 1995: "Which lattices (and in particular which
countable lattices) are sublattices of a free lattice?"
  Despite partial progress over the decades, the problem is still unsolved.
There is emphasis on the countable case because the current body of knowledge
on sublattices of free lattices is most concentrated on when these sublattices
are countably infinite.
  In this article, a simple sufficient condition for a \emph{finitely
generated} lattice to not be embeddable in a free lattice is derived, which is
easier to verify than checking if Jonsson's condition, L = D(L) = D^d(L),
holds. It provides a systematic way of providing counterexamples to the false
claim that: "all finitely generated semidistributive lattices satisfying
Whitman's condition is a sublattice of a free lattice." To the best of the
author's knowledge, this result is new. A corollary that is derived from this
is a non-trivial property of free lattices which might not yet be known in the
literature. Moreover, a problem concerning finitely generated semidistributive
lattices will be posed.

 <dc:description>Comment: I found an error in the main result of this article by finding a
  counterexample, the lattices being produced may not satisfy Whitman's
  condition. Beyond this, the procedure appears to work well. I found the
  counterexample by considering the relatively free lattice FL(2 + 2) (the
  lattice FL(2 + 2) can be found in the literature, for instance, Gratzer's
  text: General Lattice Theory, 2nd Ed)</dc:description>
