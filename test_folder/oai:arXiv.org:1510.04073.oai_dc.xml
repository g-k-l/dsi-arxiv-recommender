 <dc:description>  We give an explicit formula for the probability that the convex hull of an
$n$-step random walk in $R^d$ with centrally symmetric density of increments
does not contain the origin. This is a distribution-free result that extends
the one-dimensional formula of Sparre Andersen (1949): any symmetric
continuously distributed random walk stays positive with probability
$\frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^n n!}.$
  This probabilistic problem is shown to be equivalent to any of the following
geometric ones: 1) Find the number of Weyl chambers of type $B_n$ intersected
by a generic linear subspace in $R^n$ of codimension $d$; 2) Find the conic
intrinsic volumes of a Weyl chamber of type $B_n$. We solve the first geometric
problem using the theory of hyperplane arrangements. A corollary of our method
is a new simple proof of the general formula by Klivans and Swartz (2011)
relating the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a linear
hyperplane arrangement to the conic intrinsic volumes of the chambers
constituting its complement.
  Results analogous to the $B_n$ case are obtained for the Weyl chambers of
type $A_{n-1}$ (yielding the probability that the convex hull of a generic
random walk bridge contains the origin), type $D_n$ (with a less natural
probabilistic interpretation), and direct products of Weyl chambers (yielding
the probability that the joint convex hull of several random walks or bridges
contains the origin). The formulas again do not depend on the distribution of
increments. The simplest case of products of the form $B_1\times \ldots \times
B_1$ recovers the Wendel formula (1962) for the probability that the convex
hull of an i.i.d. multidimensional sample from a centrally symmetric
distribution does not contain the origin.
  We give an asymptotic analysis of our results as dimension $d\to\infty$
describing transition from non-absorption to absorption as number of steps $n$
increases.
