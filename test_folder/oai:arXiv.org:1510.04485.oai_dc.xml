 <dc:description>  We study general aspects of the CP-violating effects on the baryon asymmetry
of the Universe (BAU) and electric dipole moments (EDMs) in models extended by
an extra Higgs doublet and a singlet, together with electroweak-interacting
fermions. In particular, the emphasis is on the structure of the CP-violating
interactions and dependences of the BAU and EDMs on masses of the relevant
particles. In a concrete mode, we investigate a relationship between the BAU
and the electron EDM for a typical parameter set. As long as the BAU-related CP
violation predominantly exists, the electron EDM has a strong power in probing
electroweak baryogenesis. However, once a BAU-unrelated CP violation comes into
play, the direct correlation between the BAU and electron EDM can be lost. Even
in such a case, we point out that verifiability of the scenario still remains
with the help of Higgs physics.
