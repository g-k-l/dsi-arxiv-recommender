 <dc:description>  In our preceding paper: Where does Black-Hole Entropy Lie? - Some Remarks on
Area-Entropy Law, Holographic Principle and Noncommutative Space-Time (2014)
(see Introduction), we emphasized the importance of underlying noncommutative
geometry or Lorenz-covariant quantized space-time towards ultimate theory of
quantum gravity and Planck scale physics. We focused there our attention on the
statistical and substantial understanding of Bekenstein-Hawking's Area-Entropy
Law of black holes in terms of Kinematical Holographic Relation (KHR). KHR
manifestly holds in Yang's quantized space-time as the result of kinematical
reduction of spatial degrees of freedom caused by its own nature of
noncommutative geometry and plays an important role in our approach without any
recourse to the familiar hypothesis, so-called Holographic Principle. In the
present paper, we find out a {\it unified} form of KHR applicable to the whole
region ranging from macroscopic to microscopic scales in spatial dimension $
d=3.$ We notice a possibility of nontrivial modification of Area-Entropy Law of
Black Holes which becomes most remarkable in the extremely microscopic system
close to Planck scale. We finally refer to the historical background of
noncommutative geometry or quantized space-time.
