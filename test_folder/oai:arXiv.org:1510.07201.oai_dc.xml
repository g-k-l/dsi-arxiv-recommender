 <dc:description>  Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of sediment transport, particularly
those during the formation and evolution of bedforms, is of critical scientific
importance and has engineering relevance. Traditional approaches of sediment
transport simulations heavily rely on empirical models, which are not able to
capture the physics-rich, regime-dependent behaviors of the process. With the
increase of available computational resources in the past decade, CFD-DEM
(computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) has emerged as a viable
high-fidelity method for the study of sediment transport. However, a
comprehensive, quantitative study of the generation and migration of different
sediment bed patterns using CFD-DEM is still lacking. In this work,
current-induced sediment transport problems in a wide range of regimes are
simulated, including 'flat bed in motion', `small dune', `vortex dune' and
suspended transport. Simulations are performed by using SediFoam, an
open-source, massively parallel CFD-DEM solver developed by the authors. This
is a general-purpose solver for particle-laden flows tailed for particle
transport problems. Validation tests are performed to demonstrate the
capability of CFD-DEM in the full range of sediment transport regimes.
Comparison of simulation results with experimental and numerical benchmark data
demonstrates the merits of CFD-DEM approach. In addition, the improvements of
the present simulations over existing studies using CFD-DEM are presented. The
present solver gives more accurate prediction of sediment transport rate by
properly accounting for the influence of particle volume fraction on the fluid
flow. In summary, this work demonstrates that CFD-DEM is a promising
particle-resolving approach for probing the physics of current-induced sediment
transport.
