 <dc:description>  It is noted that the low-energy behavior of the pion-photon transition form
factor $F_{\pi\gamma}(Q^2)$ is sensitive to the transverse distribution of the
pion wavefunction, and its high-energy behavior is sensitive to the
longitudinal one. Thus a careful study on $F_{\pi\gamma}(Q^2)$ can provide
helpful information on the pion wavefunction precisely. In this paper, we
present a combined analysis of the data on $F_{\pi\gamma}(Q^2)$ reported by the
CELLO, the CLEO, the BABAR and the BELLE collaborations. It is performed by
using the method of least squares. By using the combined measurements of BELLE
and CLEO Collaborations, the pion wavefunction longitudinal and transverse
behavior can be fixed to a certain degree, i.e. we obtain $\beta \in
[0.691,0.757] \rm GeV$ and $B \in [0.00,0.235]$ for $P_{\chi^2} \geq 90\%$,
where $\beta$ and $B$ are two parameters of a convenient pion wavefunction
model whose distribution amplitude can mimic the various longitudinal behavior
under proper choice of parameters. We observe that the CELLO, CLEO and BELLE
data are consistent with each other, all of which prefers the asymptotic-like
distribution amplitude; while the BABAR data prefers a more broad distribution
amplitude, such as the CZ-like one.
