 <dc:description>  Synthetic data describing coherent random fluctuations have widely been used
to validate numerical sim- ulations against experimental observations or to
examine the reliability of extracting statistical properties of plasma
turbulence via correlation functions. Estimating correlation time or lengths
based on correlation functions implicitly assumes that the observed data are
stationary and homogeneous. It is, therefore, impor- tant that synthetic data
also satisfy the stationary process and homogeneous state. Based on the
synthetic data with randomly generated moving Gaussian shaped fluctuations both
in time and space, the correlation function depending on the size of averaging
time window is analytically derived. Then, the smallest possible spatial window
size of synthetic data satisfying the stationary process and homogeneous state
is proposed, thereby reducing the computation time to generate proper synthetic
data and providing a constraint on the minimum size of simulation domains when
using synthetic diagnostics to compare with experiment. This window size is
also numerically confirmed with 1D synthetic data with various parameter scans.
