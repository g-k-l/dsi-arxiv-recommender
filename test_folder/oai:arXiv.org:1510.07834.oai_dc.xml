 <dc:description>  A view of the Galactic bulge by means of their globular clusters is necessary
for a deep understanding of its formation and evolution. Connections between
the globular cluster and field star properties in terms of kinematics, orbits,
chemical abundances and ages should shed light on different stellar population
components. Based on spatial distribution and metallicity, we define a probable
best list of bulge clusters, containing 43 entries. Future work on newly
discovered objects, mostly from the VVV survey, is suggested. These candidates
might alleviate the issue of missing clusters on the far side of the bulge. We
discuss the reddening law affecting the cluster distances towards the center of
the Galaxy, and conclude that the most suitable total-to-selective absorption
value appears to be R$_{\rm V}$=3.2, in agreement with recent analyses. An
update of elemental abundances for bulge clusters is provided.
