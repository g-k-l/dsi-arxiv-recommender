 <dc:description>  Spin systems controlled and probed by magnetic resonance have been valuable
for testing the ideas of quantum control and quantum error correction. This
paper introduces an X-band pulsed electron spin resonance spectrometer designed
for high-fidelity coherent control of electron spins, including a loop-gap
resonator for sub-millimeter sized samples with a control bandwidth ~ 40 MHz.
Universal control is achieved by a single-sideband upconversion technique with
an I-Q modulator and a 1.2 GS/s arbitrary waveform generator. A single qubit
randomized benchmarking protocol quantifies the average errors of Clifford
gates implemented by simple Gaussian pulses, using a sample of gamma-irradiated
quartz. Improvements in unitary gate fidelity are achieved through phase
transient correction and hardware optimization. A preparation pulse sequence
that selects spin packets in a narrowed distribution of static fields confirms
that inhomogeneous dephasing (1/T2*) is the dominant source of gate error. The
best average fidelity over the Clifford gates obtained here is 99.2%, which
serves as a benchmark to compare with other technologies.
