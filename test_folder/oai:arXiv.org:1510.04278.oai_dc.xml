 <dc:description>  We propose a series of simple $2d$ lattice interacting fermion models that we
demonstrate at low energy describe bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT)
states and quantum phase transitions between them. This is because due to
interaction the fermions are gapped both at the boundary of the SPT states and
at the bulk quantum phase transition, thus these models at low energy can be
described completely by bosonic degrees of freedom. We show that the bulk of
these models is described by a Sp($N$) principal chiral model with a
topological $\Theta$-term, whose boundary is described by a Sp($N$) principal
chiral model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term at level-1. The quantum phase
transition between SPT states in the bulk is tuned by a particular interaction
term, which corresponds to tuning $\Theta$ in the field theory, and the phase
transition occurs at $\Theta = \pi$. The simplest version of these models with
$N=1$ is equivalent to the familiar O(4) nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) with a
topological term, whose boundary is a $(1+1)d$ conformal field theory with
central charge $c = 1$. After breaking the O(4) symmetry to its subgroups, this
model can be viewed as bosonic SPT states with U(1), or $Z_2$ symmetries, etc.
All these fermion models including the bulk quantum phase transitions can be
simulated with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method without the sign problem.
Recent numerical results strongly suggests that the quantum disordered phase of
the O(4) NLSM with precisely $\Theta = \pi$ is a stable $(2+1)d$ conformal
field theory (CFT) with gapless bosonic modes.
