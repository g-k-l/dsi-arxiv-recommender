 <dc:description>  Caching is a promising solution to satisfy the ever-increasing demands for
the multi-media traffics. In caching networks, coded caching is a recently
proposed technique that achieves significant performance gains over the uncoded
caching schemes. However, to implement the coded caching schemes, each file has
to be split into $F$ packets, which usually increases exponentially with the
number of users $K$. Thus, designing caching schemes that decrease the order of
$F$ is meaningful for practical implementations. In this paper, by reviewing
the Ali-Niesen caching scheme, the placement delivery array (PDA) design
problem is firstly formulated to characterize the placement issue and the
delivery issue with a single array. Moreover, it is disclosed that the problem
of designing a centralized coded caching scheme can be translated into a
problem of designing an appropriate PDA. Secondly, it is shown that the
Ali-Niesen scheme corresponds to a special class of PDA, which realizes the
best coding gain with the least $F$. Thirdly, we present a new construction of
PDA for the centralized caching system, wherein the cache size of each user
(identical cache size is assumed at all users) is a fraction $1/q$ or
${(q-1)}/{q}$ ($q$ is an integer such that $q\geq 2$) of the server. The new
construction can decrease the required $F$ from the order
$O\left(e^{K\cdot\left(\frac{1}{q}\ln q+(1-\frac{1}{q})\ln
\frac{q}{q-1}\right)}\right)$ of Ali-Niesen scheme to
$O\left(e^{K\cdot\frac{1}{q}\ln q}\right)$, which saves a factor of
$O\left(e^{K\cdot(1-\frac{1}{q})\ln\frac{q}{q-1}}\right)$ that increases
exponentially with $K$, while the coding gain loss is only $1$.
