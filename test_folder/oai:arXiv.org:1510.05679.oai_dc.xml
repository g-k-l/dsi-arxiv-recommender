 <dc:description>  We define and investigate HC-forcing invariant formulas of set theory, whose
interpretations in the hereditarily countable sets are well behaved under
forcing extensions. This leads naturally to a notion of cardinality ||Phi|| for
sentences Phi of $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$, which counts the number of sentences of
$L_{\infty,\omega}$ that, in some forcing extension, become a canonical Scott
sentence of a model of Phi. We show this cardinal bounds the complexity of
(Mod(Phi), iso), the class of models of Phi with universe omega, by proving
that (Mod(Phi),iso) is not Borel reducible to (Mod(Psi),iso) whenever ||Psi|| &lt;
||Phi||.
  Using these tools, we analyze the complexity of the class of countable models
of four complete, first-order theories T for which (Mod(T),iso) is properly
analytic, yet admit very different behavior. We prove that both `Binary
splitting, refining equivalence relations' and Koerwien's example of an
eni-depth 2, omega-stable theory have (Mod(T),iso) non-Borel, yet neither is
Borel complete. We give a slight modification of Koerwien's example that also
is omega-stable, eni-depth 2, but is Borel complete. Additionally, we prove
that I_{\infty,\omega}(Phi)&lt;\beth_{\omega_1} whenever (Mod(Phi),iso) is Borel.
