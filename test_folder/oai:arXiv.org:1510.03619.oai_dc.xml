 <dc:description>  Cold atomic gases have provided us with a great number of opportunities for
studying various physical systems under controlled conditions that are seldom
offered in other fields. We are thus at the point where one can truly do
quantum simulation of models that are relevant for instance in condensed-matter
or high-energy physics, i.e. we are on the verge of a 'cool' quantum simulator
as envisioned by Feynman. One of the avenues under exploration is the physics
of one-dimensional systems. Until recently this was mostly in the many-body
limit but now experiments can be performed with controllable particle numbers
all the way down to the few-body regime. After a brief introduction to some of
the relevant experiments, I will review recent theoretical work on
one-dimensional quantum systems containing bosons, fermions, or mixtures of the
two, with a particular emphasis on the case where the particles are held by an
external trap.
