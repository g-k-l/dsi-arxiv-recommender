 <dc:description>  Two-phase turbulent Taylor-Couette (TC) flow is simulated using an
Euler-Lagrange approach to study the effects of a secondary phase dispersed
into a turbulent carrier phase (here bubbles dispersed into water). The
dynamics of the carrier phase is computed using Direct Numerical Simulations
(DNS) in an Eulerian framework, while the bubbles are tracked in a Lagrangian
manner by modelling the effective drag, lift, added mass and buoyancy force
acting on them. Two-way coupling is implemented between the dispersed phase and
the carrier phase which allows for momentum exchange among both phases and to
study the effect of the dispersed phase on the carrier phase dynamics. The
radius ratio of the TC setup is fixed to $\eta=0.833$, and a maximum inner
cylinder Reynolds number of $Re_i=8000$ is reached. We vary the Froude number
($Fr$), which is the ratio of the centripetal to the gravitational acceleration
of the dispersed phase and study its effect on the net torque required to drive
the TC system. For the two-phase TC system, we observe drag reduction, i.e.,
the torque required to drive the inner cylinder is less compared to that of the
single phase system. The net drag reduction decreases with increasing Reynolds
number $Re_i$, which is consistent with previous experimental findings (Murai
et al. 2005, 2008). The drag reduction is strongly related to the Froude
number: for fixed Reynolds number we observe higher drag reduction when $Fr &lt;
1$ than for with$ Fr &gt; 1$. This buoyancy effect is more prominent in low $Re_i$
systems and decreases with increasing Reynolds number $Re_i$. We trace the drag
reduction back to the weakening of the angular momentum carrying Taylor rolls
by the rising bubbles.
