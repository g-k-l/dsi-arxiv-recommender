 <dc:description>  We present analysis of fast variability of Very Large Telescope/ISAAC
(infra-red), \textit{XMM-Newton}/OM (optical) and EPIC-pn (X-ray), and RXTE/PCA
(X-ray) observations of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 in a rising hard
state of its outburst in 2010. We report the first detection of a Quasi
Periodic Oscillation (QPO) in the infra-red band (IR) of a black hole X-ray
binary. The QPO is detected at 0.08 Hz in the IR as well as two optical bands
(U and V). Interestingly, these QPOs are at half the X-ray QPO frequency at
0.16 Hz, which is classified as the type-C QPO; a weak sub-harmonic close to
the IR and optical QPO frequency is also detected in X-rays. The broad band
sub-second time scale variability is strongly correlated in IR/X-ray bands,
with X-rays leading the IR by over 100 ms. This short time delay, shape of the
cross correlation function and spectral energy distribution strongly indicate
that this broad band variable IR emission is the synchrotron emission from the
jet. A jet origin for the IR QPO is strongly favoured, but cannot be
definitively established with the current data. The spectral energy
distribution indicates a thermal disc origin for the bulk of the optical
emission, but the origin of the optical QPO is unclear. We discuss our findings
in the context of the existing models proposed to explain the origin of
variability.
