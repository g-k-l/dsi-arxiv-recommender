 <dc:description>  We develop a general hydrodynamic framework for computing direct current
thermal and electric transport in a strongly interacting finite temperature
quantum system near a Lorentz-invariant quantum critical point. Our framework
is non-perturbative in the strength of long wavelength fluctuations in the
background charge density of the electronic fluid, and requires the rate of
electron-electron scattering to be faster than the rate of electron-impurity
scattering. We use this formalism to compute transport coefficients in the
Dirac fluid in clean samples of graphene near the charge neutrality point, and
find results insensitive to long range Coulomb interactions. Numerical results
are compared to recent experimental data on thermal and electrical conductivity
in the Dirac fluid in graphene and substantially improved quantitative
agreement over existing hydrodynamic theories is found. We comment on the
interplay between the Dirac fluid and acoustic and optical phonons, and
qualitatively explain experimentally observed effects. Our work paves the way
for quantitative contact between experimentally realized condensed matter
systems and the wide body of high energy inspired theories on transport in
interacting many-body quantum systems.
