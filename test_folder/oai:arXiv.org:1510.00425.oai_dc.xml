 <dc:description>  Minimal models of active Brownian colloids consisting of self-propelled
spherical particles with purely repulsive interactions have recently been
identified as excellent quantitative testing grounds for theories of active
matter and have been the subject of extensive numerical and analytical
investigation. These systems do not exhibit aligned or flocking states, but do
have a rich phase diagram, forming active gases, liquids and solids with novel
mechanical properties. This article reviews recent advances in the
understanding of such models, including the description of the active gas and
its swim pressure, the motility-induced phase separation and the high-density
crystalline and glassy behavior.
