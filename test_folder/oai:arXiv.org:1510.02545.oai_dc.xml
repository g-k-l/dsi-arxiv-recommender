 <dc:description>  We report some computational results comparing parallel and sequential codes
for vertex/facet enumeration problems for convex polyhedra. The problems chosen
span the range from simple to highly degenerate polytopes. We tested one code
(lrs) based on pivoting and four codes (cddr+, ppl, normaliz, PORTA) based on
the double description method. normaliz employs parallelization as do the codes
plrs and mplrs which are based on lrs. We tested these codes using various
hardware configurations with up to 1200 cores. Major speedups were obtained by
parallelization, particularly by the code mplrs which uses MPI and can operate
on clusters of machines.

 <dc:description>Comment: 7 pages, 6 tables. Revised version now includes PORTA, normaliz and
  v6.2 of lrslib. The cluster and test set used were also expanded. Broken
  table footnote fixed</dc:description>
