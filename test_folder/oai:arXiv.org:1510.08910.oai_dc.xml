 <dc:description>  Stable ultrashort light pulses and frequency combs generated by mode-locked
lasers have many important applications including high-resolution spectroscopy,
fast chemical detection and identification, studies of ultrafast processes, and
laser metrology. While compact mode-locked lasers emitting in the visible and
near infrared range have revolutionized photonic technologies, the systems
operating in the mid-infrared range where most gases have their strong
absorption lines, are bulky and expensive and rely on nonlinear frequency
down-conversion. Quantum cascade lasers are the most powerful and versatile
compact light sources in the mid-infrared range, yet achieving their mode
locked operation remains a challenge despite dedicated effort. Here we report
the first demonstration of active mode locking of an external-cavity quantum
cascade laser. The laser operates in the mode-locked regime at room temperature
and over the full dynamic range of injection currents of a standard commercial
laser chip.
