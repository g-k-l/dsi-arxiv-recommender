 <dc:description>  Charge transfer (CT) is essential to numerous fields including biology,
physics and chemistry. Here, we demonstrate that multi-layered hyperbolic
metamaterial (HMM) substrates alter CT dynamics. With triphenylene:perylene
diimide dyad supramolecular self-assemblies, we show that both charge
separation and recombination characteristic times are increased by factors of
2.4 and 1.7, i.e. relative variations of 140 and 73 %, respectively, resulting
in longer-lived CT states. We successfully rationalise the experimental data by
introducing dipole image interactions in Marcus theory to tune the driving
force. The number of metal-dielectric pairs induces a non-local effect near the
HMM structure formalised in the dielectric permittivity, and is presented as a
solid analogue to local solvent polarizability effects. The model and
PH3T:PC60BM data show the phenomenon generality and that molecular and
substrate engineering offers a wide range of kinetic tailoring opportunities.
This work opens the path toward novel artificial substrates designed to control
CT dynamics with potential applications in fields including optoelectronics and
chemistry.
