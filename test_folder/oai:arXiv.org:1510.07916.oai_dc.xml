 <dc:description>  One possible framework to interpret the irreversibility transition observed
in periodically driven colloidal suspensions is that of a non-equilibrium phase
transition towards an absorbing reversible state at low amplitude of the
driving force. We consider a simple numerical model for driven suspensions
which allows us to characterize in great detail a large body of physical
observables that can be experimentally determined to assess the existence and
universality class of such a non-equilibrium phase transition. Characterizing
the behaviour of static and dynamic correlation functions both in real and
Fourier space we determine in particular several critical exponents for our
model, which take values that are in good agreement with the universality class
of direct ed percolation. We also provide a detailed analysis of
single-particle and collective dynamics of the system near the phase
transition, which appear intermittent and spatially correlated over diverging
timescales and lengthscales, and provide clear signatures of the underlying
criticality.
