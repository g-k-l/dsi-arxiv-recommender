 <dc:description>  Coverage optimization is an important process for the operator as it is a
crucial prerequisite towards offering a satisfactory quality of service to the
end-users. The first step of this process is coverage prediction, which can be
performed by interpolating geo-located measurements reported to the network by
mobile users' equipments. In previous works, we proposed a low complexity
coverage prediction algorithm based on the adaptation of the Geo-statistics
Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK) algorithm. We supposed that the geo-location
information reported with the radio measurements was perfect, which is not the
case in reality. In this paper, we study the impact of location uncertainty on
the coverage prediction accuracy and we extend the previously proposed
algorithm to include geo-location error in the prediction model. We validate
the proposed algorithm using both simulated and real field measurements. The
FRK extended to take into account the location uncertainty proves to enhance
the prediction accuracy while keeping a reasonable computational complexity.
