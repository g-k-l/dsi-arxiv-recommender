 <dc:description>  Quantum oscillations of metallic systems at low temperatures is one of the
key rules to experimentally access their electronic properties, such as energy
spectrum, scattering mechanisms, geometry of Fermi surface and many other
features. The importance of these knowledge is enormous, since from these a
thorough understanding of anomalous Hall effect, thermopower and Nernst
coefficients, just to name a few, is possible; and from those knowledge, a
plenty of applications arise as emerging technologies. In this direction, the
present contribution focus on a complete description of quantum capacitance
oscillations of monolayer and bilayer graphenes under crossed electric and
magnetic fields. We found a closed theoretical expression for the quantum
capacitance and highlight their amplitude, period and phase - important
parameters to access the electronic properties of graphenes. These results open
doors for further experimental studies.
