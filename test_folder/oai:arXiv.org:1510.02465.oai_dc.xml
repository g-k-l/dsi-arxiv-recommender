 <dc:description>  Fusion energy from reacting hydrogen (protons) with the boron isotope 11
(HB11) resulting in three stable helium nuclei, is without problem of nuclear
radiation in contrast to DT fusion. But the HB11 reaction driven by nanosecond
laser pulses with thermal compression and ignition by lasers is extremely
difficult. This changed radically when irradiation with picosecond laser pulses
produces a non-thermal plasma block ignition with ultrahigh acceleration. This
uses the nonlinear (ponderomotive) force to surprisingly resulting in same
thresholds as DT fusion even under pessimistic assumption of binary reactions.
After evaluation of reactions trapped cylindrically by kilotesla magnetic
fields and using the measured highly increased HB11 fusion gains for the proof
of an avalanche of the three alphas in secondary reactions, possibilities for
an absolutely clean energy source at competitive costs were concluded.
