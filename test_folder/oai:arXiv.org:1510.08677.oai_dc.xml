 <dc:description>  Asteroseismology allows for deriving precise values of surface gravity of
stars. The accurate asteroseismic determinations now available for large number
of stars in the Kepler fields can be used to check and calibrate surface
gravities that are currently being obtained spectroscopically for a huge
numbers of stars targeted by large-scale spectroscopic surveys, such as the
on-going Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)
Galactic survey. The LAMOST spectral surveys have obtained a large number of
stellar spectra in the Kepler fields. Stellar atmospheric parameters of those
stars have been determined with the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline at Peking
University (LSP3), by template matching with the MILES empirical spectral
library. In the current work, we compare surface gravities yielded by LSP3 with
those of two asteroseismic samples - the largest sample from Huber et al.
(2014) and the most accurate sample from Hekker et al. (2012, 2013). We find
that LSP3 surface gravities are in good agreement with asteroseismic values of
Hekker et al. (2012, 2013), with a dispersion of about 0.2 dex. Except for a
few cases, asteroseismic surface gravities of Huber et al. (2014) and LSP3
spectroscopic values agree for a wide range of surface gravities. However, some
patterns of differences can be identified upon close inspection. Potential ways
to further improve the LSP3 spectroscopic estimation of stellar atmospheric
parameters in the near future are briefly discussed. The effects of effective
temperature and metallicity on asteroseismic determinations of surface
gravities for giant stars are also discussed.
