 <dc:description>  Bicircular lift matroids are a class of matroids defined on the edge set of a
graph. For a given graph $G$, the circuits of its bicircular lift matroid are
the edge sets of those subgraphs of $G$ that contain at least two cycles, and
are minimal with respect to this property. The main result of this paper is a
characterization of when two graphs give rise to the same bicircular lift
matoid, which answers a question proposed by Irene Pivotto. In particular,
aside from some appropriately defined "small" graphs, two graphs have the same
bicircular lift matroid if and only if they are $2$-isomorphic in the sense of
Whitney.
