 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider narrow band, active array imaging of weak localized
scatterers when only the intensities are recorded at an array with N
transducers. We consider that the medium is homogeneous and, hence, wave
propagation is fully coherent. This work is an extension of our previous paper,
where we showed that using linear combinations of intensity-only measurements
imaging of localized scatterers can be carried out efficiently using MUSIC or
sparsity promoting optimization. Here we show the same strategy can be
accomplished with only 3N-2 illuminations, therefore reducing enormously the
data acquisition process. Furthermore, we show that in the paraxial regime one
can form the images by using six illuminations only. In particular, this
paraxial regime includes Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. The key point of
this work is that if one controls the illuminations, imaging with
intensity-only can be easily reduced to a imaging with phases and, therefore,
one can apply standard imaging techniques. Detailed numerical simulations
illustrate the performance of the proposed imaging strategy with and without
data noise.
