 <dc:description>  We calculate the dispersion relations of plasmonic waves propagating along a
chain of semiconducting or metallic nanoparticles in the presence of both a
static magnetic field ${\bf B}$ and a liquid crystalline host. The dispersion
relations are obtained using the quasistatic approximation and a dipole-dipole
approximation to treat the interaction between surface plasmons on different
nanoparticles. For a plasmons propagating along a particle chain in a nematic
liquid crystalline host with both ${\bf B}$ and the director parallel to the
chain, we find a small, but finite, Faraday rotation angle. For ${\bf B}$
perpendicular to the chain, but director still parallel to the chain, the field
couples the longitudinal and one of the two transverse plasmonic branches. This
coupling is shown to split the two branches at the zero field crossing by an
amount proportional to $|{\bf B}|$. In a cholesteric liquid crystal host and an
applied magnetic field parallel to the chain, the dispersion relations for
left- and right-moving waves are found to be different. For some frequencies,
the plasmonic wave propagates only in one of the two directions.
