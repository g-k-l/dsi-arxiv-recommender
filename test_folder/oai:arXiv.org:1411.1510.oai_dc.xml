 <dc:description>  For actions of a sofic group on probability spaces, the entropy has been
defined by Bowen, with an extension by Kerr-Li. In particular, when the action
is by homeomorphisms of a compact space preserving a given measure, Kerr-Li
show one can compute the measure-theoretic entropy in a manner which uses the
topology of the space. We show how to compute the entropy of a an action of
homeomorphisms of a Polish space preserving a given measure, also in a manner
which uses the topology of the space. We give applications to spectral
properties of actions with positive entropy, as well as for actions of
completely positive entropy.

 <dc:description>Comment: 26 pages. Removed the section on distal actions as we will prove more
  general results in "Mixing and Spectral Gap Relative to Pinsker Factors for
  Sofic Groups". This is the final version to appear in Journal of Institute of
  Mathematics of Jussieu</dc:description>
