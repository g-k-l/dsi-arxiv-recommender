 <dc:description>  Enterprise software systems make complex interactions with other services in
their environment. Developing and testing for production-like conditions is
therefore a challenging task. Prior approaches include emulations of the
dependency services using either explicit modelling or record-and-replay
approaches. Models require deep knowledge of the target services while
record-and-replay is limited in accuracy. We present a new technique that
improves the accuracy of record-and-replay approaches, without requiring prior
knowledge of the services. The approach uses multiple sequence alignment to
derive message prototypes from recorded system interactions and a scheme to
match incoming request messages against message prototypes to generate response
messages. We introduce a modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for distance
calculation during message matching, wildcards in message prototypes for high
variability sections, and entropy-based weightings in distance calculations for
increased accuracy. Combined, our new approach has shown greater than 99%
accuracy for four evaluated enterprise system messaging protocols.
