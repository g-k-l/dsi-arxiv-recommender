 <dc:description>  A semantics for quantified modal logic is presented that is based on Kleene's
notion of realizability. This semantics generalizes Flagg's 1985 construction
of a model of a modal version of Church's Thesis and first-order arithmetic.
While the bulk of the paper is devoted to developing the details of the
semantics, to illustrate the scope of this approach, we show that the
construction produces (i) a model of a modal version of Church's Thesis and a
variant of a modal set theory due to Goodman and Scedrov, (ii) a model of a
modal version of Troelstra's generalized continuity principle together with a
fragment of second-order arithmetic, and (iii) a model based on Scott's graph
model (for the untyped lambda calculus) which witnesses the failure of the
stability of non-identity.
