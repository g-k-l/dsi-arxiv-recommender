 <dc:description>  Ratios of line of sight baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peaks at two
redshifts only depend upon the average dark energy equation of states between
those redshifts, as the dependence on anchors such as the BAO scale or the
Hubble constant is canceled in a ratio. As a result, BAO ratios provide a probe
of dark energy which is independent of both the cosmic distance ladder and the
early evolution of universe. In this note, we use ratios to demonstrate that
the known tension between the Lyman alpha forest BAO measurement and other
probes arises entirely from recent (0.57&lt;z&lt;2.34) cosmological expansion. Using
ratios of the line of sight Lyman alpha forest and BOSS CMASS BAO scales, we
show that there is already more than 3 sigma tension with the standard
LambdaCDM cosmological model which implies that either (i) The BOSS Lyman alpha
forest measurement of the Hubble parameter was too low as a result of a
statistical fluctuation or systematic error or else (ii) the dark energy
equation of state falls steeply at high redshift.
