 <dc:description>  The Yang--Mills gradient flow and its extension to the fermion field provide
a very general method to obtain renormalized observables in gauge theory. The
method is applicable also with non-perturbative regularization such as lattice.
The gradient flow thus offers useful probes to study non-perturbative dynamics
of gauge theory. In this work, aiming at possible simplification in
perturbative calculations associated with the gradient flow, a modification of
the gauge-fixed version of the flow equation, which preserves gauge covariance
under the background gauge transformation, is proposed. This formulation allows
for example a very quick one-loop calculation of the small flow time expansion
of a composite operator that is relevant to the construction of a lattice
energy--momentum tensor. Some details of the calculation, which have not been
given elsewhere, are presented.
