 <dc:description>  The possibility that some meteoroids in the size range 1 - 20 meters are
rubble piles i.e. assembles of boulders of various sizes held together only by
small van der Waals forces, is investigated. Such meteoroids are expected to
start disrupting into individual pieces during the atmospheric entry at very
low dynamic pressures of ~ 25 Pa, even before the onset of ablation. The
heterogeneous bodies as Almahata Sitta (asteroid 2008 TC3) and Benesov are
primary candidates for rubble piles. Nevertheless, by analyzing the
deceleration, wake, and light curve of the Benesov bolide, we found that the
meteoroid disruption started only at a height of 70 km under dynamic pressure
of 50 kPa. No evidence for a very early fragmentation was found also for the
Chelyabinsk event.
