 <dc:description>  In Alonso et al., JHEP 12 (2014) 034, the CP-even sector of the effective
chiral Lagrangian for a generic composite Higgs model with a symmetric coset
has been constructed, up to four momenta. In this paper, the CP-odd couplings
are studied within the same context. If only the Standard Model bosonic sources
of custodial symmetry breaking are considered, then at most six independent
operators form a basis. One of them is the weak-$\theta$ term linked to
non-perturbative sources of CP viola- tion, while the others describe CP-odd
perturbative couplings between the Standard Model gauge bosons and an
Higgs-like scalar belonging to the Goldstone boson sector. The procedure is
then applied to three distinct exemplifying frameworks: the original
$SU(5)/SO(5)$ Georgi-Kaplan model, the minimal custodial-preserving
$SO(5)/SO(4)$ model and the minimal $SU(3)/(SU(2)\times U(1))$ model, which
intrinsically breaks cus- todial symmetry. Moreover, the projection of the
high-energy electroweak effective theory to the low-energy chiral effective
Lagrangian for a dynamical Higgs is per- formed, uncovering strong relations
between the operator coefficients and pinpointing the differences with the
elementary Higgs scenario.
