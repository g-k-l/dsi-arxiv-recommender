 <dc:description>  We investigate the gravitational collapse of a non-rotating $n$-dimensional
BTZ black hole in AdS space in the context of both classical and quantum
mechanics. This is done by first deriving the conserved mass of a "spherically"
symmetric domain wall, which is taken as the classical Hamiltonian of the black
hole. Upon deriving the conserved mass, we also point out that, for a
"spherically" symmetric shell, there is an easy and straight-forward way of
determining the conserved mass, which is related to the proper time derivative
of the interior and exterior times. This method for determining the conserved
mass is generic to any situation (i.e. any equation of state), since it only
depends on the energy per unit area, $\sigma$, of the shell.
  Classically, we show that the time taken for gravitational collapse follows
that of the typical formation of a black hole via gravitational collapse, that
is, an asymptotic observer will see that the collapse takes an infinite amount
of time to occur, while an infalling observer will see the collapse to both the
horizon and the classical singularity occur in a finite amount of time. Quantum
mechanically, we take primary interest in the behavior of the collapse near the
horizon and near the classical singularity from the point of view of both
asymptotic and infalling observers. In the absence of radiation and
fluctuations of the metric, quantum effects near the horizon do not change the
classical conclusions for an asymptotic observer. The most interesting quantum
mechanical effect comes in when investigating near the classical singularity.
Here, we find, that the quantum effects in this region are able to remove the
classical singularity at the origin, since the wave function is non-singular,
and is also displays non-local effects, which depend on the energy density of
the domain wall.
