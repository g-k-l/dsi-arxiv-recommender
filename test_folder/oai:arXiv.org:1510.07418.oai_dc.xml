 <dc:description>  Cells use temporal dynamical patterns to transmit information via signaling
pathways. As optimality with respect to the environment plays a fundamental
role in biological systems, organisms have evolved optimal ways to transmit
information. Here, we use optimal control theory to obtain the optimal
dynamical signal patterns that can transmit information efficiently (low
energy) and reliably (high accuracy). Adopting an activation-inactivation
decoding network, we reproduce several dynamical patterns found in actual
signals, such as steep, gradual, and overshooting dynamics. Notably, when
minimizing the energy of the input signal, the optimal signals exhibit
overshooting, which is a biphasic pattern with transient and steady phases;
this pattern is prevalent in actual dynamical patterns. We also identify
conditions when these three patterns (steep, gradual, and overshooting) confer
advantages.
