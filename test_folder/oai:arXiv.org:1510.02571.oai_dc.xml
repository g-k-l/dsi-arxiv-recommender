 <dc:description>  In this paper we prove a homological stability theorem for the diffeomorphism
groups of high dimensional manifolds with boundary, with respect to forming the
boundary connected sum with the product $D^{p+1}\times S^{q}$ for $|q - p| &lt;
\min\{p, q\} - 2$. The main theorem is analogous to an earlier paper of the
same author that proves a homological stability theorem for the diffeomorphism
group of a manifold with respect to forming the connected sum with the product
of spheres $S^{p}\times S^{q}$ (see arXiv:1408.1903 ).
  In a recent joint paper with Boris Botvinnik (see arXiv:1509.03359 ), we
identify the homology of $colim_{g\to \infty}BDiff((D^{n+1}\times
S^{n})^{\natural g}, \; D^{2n})$ with that of the infinite loopspace
$Q_{0}BO(2n+1)\langle n\rangle_{+}$, in the case that $n \geq 4$. By combining
this "stable homology" calculation with the results of this current paper we
may compute the (co)homology groups of $BDiff((D^{n+1}\times S^{n})^{\natural
g}, D^{2n})$ in degrees $k \leq \tfrac{1}{2}(g - 4)$. This leads to the
determination of the characteristic classes in degrees $k \leq \tfrac{1}{2}(g -
4)$ for all smooth fibre-bundles with fibre diffeomorphic to $(D^{n+1}\times
S^{n})^{\natural g}$.
