 <dc:description>  This work deals with integration and transmission of safety information for
smart railway vehicles and control and design of cooperative emergency brake
systems for high speed trains. Due to increased speed of high-speed train,
safety of passengers is becoming more critical. From this perspective, three
different approaches to ensure the safety of passengers are useful. These
approaches are based on integrated use of multi-sensors and emergency brake
system. Methodology for integrated use of sensors to obtain situation-aware
safety related information and for enhanced braking is to be discussed in
details in this work
