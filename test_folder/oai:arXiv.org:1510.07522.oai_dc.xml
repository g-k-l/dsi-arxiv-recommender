 <dc:description>  A new algorithm, denoted by RSRR, is presented for solving large-scale
nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) with a focus on improving the robustness
and reliability of the solution, which is a challenging task in computational
science and engineering. The proposed algorithm utilizes the Rayleigh-Ritz
procedure to compute all eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors lying
within a given contour in the complex plane. The main novelties are the
following. First and foremost, the approximate eigenspace is constructed by
using the values of the resolvent at a series of sampling points on the
contour, which effectively circumvented the unreliability of previous schemes
that using high-order contour moments of the resolvent. Secondly, an improved
Sakurai-Sugiura algorithm is proposed to solve the projected NEPs with
enhancements on reliability and accuracy. The user-defined probing matrix in
the original algorithm is avoided and the number of eigenvalues is determined
automatically by provided strategies. Finally, by approximating the projected
matrices with the Chebyshev interpolation technique, RSRR is further extended
to solve NEPs in the boundary element method, which is typically difficult due
to the densely populated matrices and high computational costs. The good
performance of RSRR is demonstrated by a variety of benchmark examples and
large-scale practical applications, with the degrees of freedom ranging from
several hundred up to around one million. The algorithm is suitable for
parallelization and easy to implement in conjunction with other programs and
software.
