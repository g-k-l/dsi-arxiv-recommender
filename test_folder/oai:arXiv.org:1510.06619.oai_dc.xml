 <dc:description>  The Lane-Emden type equations are employed in the modelling of several
phenomena in the areas of mathematical physics and astrophysics . In this paper
a new numerical method is applied to investigate some well-known classes of
Lane-Emden type equations which are nonlinear ordinary differential equations
on the semi-infinite domain. We will apply a mesh-less method based on radial
basis function differential quadrature method. In RBFs-DQ the derivative value
of function with respect to a point is directly approximated by a linear
combination of all functional values in the global domain . The main aim of
this method is the determination of weight coefficients. Here we concentrate on
Gaussian(GS) as a radial function for approximating the solution of the
mentioned equation. The comparison of the results with the other numerical
methods shows the efficiency and accuracy of this method.
