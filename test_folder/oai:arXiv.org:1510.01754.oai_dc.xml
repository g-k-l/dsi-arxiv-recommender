 <dc:description>  The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), the last member of Hall family, was
predicted to exhibit quantized Hall conductivity e2/h without any external
magnetic field. The QAHE shares a similar physical phenomenon with the integer
quantum Hall effect (QHE), whereas its physical origin relies on the intrinsic
topological inverted band structure and ferromagnetism. Since the QAHE does not
require external energy input in the form of magnetic field, it is believed
that this effect has unique potential for applications in future electronic
devices with low-power consumption. More recently, the QAHE has been
experimentally observed in thin films of the time-reversal symmetry breaking
ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulators (TI), Cr- and V- doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3.
In this Topical Review, we review the history of TI based QAHE, the route to
the experimental observation of the QAHE in the above two systems, the current
status of the research of the QAHE, and finally the prospects for future
studies.
