 <dc:description>  A pet that goes missing is among many people's worst fears: a moment of
distraction is enough for a dog or a cat wandering off from home. Some measures
help matching lost animals to their owners; but automated visual recognition is
one that - although convenient, highly available, and low-cost - is
surprisingly overlooked. In this paper, we inaugurate that promising avenue by
pursuing face recognition for dogs. We contrast four ready-to-use human facial
recognizers (EigenFaces, FisherFaces, LBPH, and a Sparse method) to two
original solutions based upon convolutional neural networks: BARK (inspired in
architecture-optimized networks employed for human facial recognition) and WOOF
(based upon off-the-shelf OverFeat features). Human facial recognizers perform
poorly for dogs (up to 60.5% accuracy), showing that dog facial recognition is
not a trivial extension of human facial recognition. The convolutional network
solutions work much better, with BARK attaining up to 81.1% accuracy, and WOOF,
89.4%. The tests were conducted in two datasets: Flickr-dog, with 42 dogs of
two breeds (pugs and huskies); and Snoopybook, with 18 mongrel dogs.
