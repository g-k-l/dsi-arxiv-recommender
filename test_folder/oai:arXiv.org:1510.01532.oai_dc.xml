 <dc:description>  We consider an isolated vortex in the two-dimensional proximity-induced
superconducting state formed at the interface of a three-dimensional strong
topological insulator (TI) and an s-wave superconductor (sSC). Prior
calculations of the bound states of this system famously revealed a zero-energy
state that is its own conjugate, a Majorana fermion bound to the vortex core.
We calculate, not the bound states, but the scattering states of this system,
and ask how the spin-momentum-locked massless Dirac form of the single-particle
Hamiltonian, inherited from the TI surface, affects the cross section for
scattering Bogoliubov quasiparticles from the vortex. As in the case of an
ordinary superconductor, this is a two-channel problem with the vortex mixing
particle-like and hole-like excitations. And as in the ordinary case, the
same-channel differential cross section diverges in the forward direction due
to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, resulting in an infinite total cross section but
finite transport and skew cross sections. We calculate the transport and skew
cross sections numerically, via a partial wave analysis, as a function of both
quasiparticle excitation energy and chemical potential. Novel effects emerge as
particle-like or hole-like excitations are tuned through the Dirac point.
