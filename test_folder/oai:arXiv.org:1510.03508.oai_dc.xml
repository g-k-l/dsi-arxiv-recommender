 <dc:description>  The de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory allows the
existence of physical states that violate the Born probability rule. Recent
work has shown that in pilot-wave field theory on expanding space relaxation to
the Born rule is suppressed for long-wavelength field modes, resulting in a
large-scale power deficit {\xi}(k) which for a radiation-dominated expansion is
found to have an approximate inverse-tangent dependence on k (assuming that the
width of the initial distribution is smaller than the width of the initial
Born-rule distribution and that the initial quantum states are evenly-weighted
superpositions of energy states). In this paper we show that the functional
form of {\xi}(k) is robust under changes in the initial nonequilibrium
distribution -- subject to the limitation of a subquantum width -- as well as
under the addition of an inflationary era at the end of the radiation-dominated
phase. In both cases the predicted deficit {\xi}(k) remains an inverse-tangent
function of k. Furthermore, with the inflationary phase the dependence of the
fitting parameters on the number of superposed pre-inflationary energy states
is comparable to that found previously. Our results indicate that, for the
assumed broad class of initial conditions, an inverse-tangent power deficit is
likely to be a fairly general and robust signature of quantum relaxation in the
early universe.
