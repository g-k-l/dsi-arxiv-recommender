 <dc:description>  In the present paper we consider the following Satisfaction Problem of
Consumers Demands (SPCD): {\it The supplier must supply the measurable system
of the measure $m_k$ to the $k$-th consumer at the moment $t_k$ for $1 \le k
\le n$. The measure of the supplied measurable system is changed under action
of some dynamical system; What minimal measure of measurable system must take
the supplier at the initial moment $t=0$ to satisfy demands of all consumers ?
} In this paper we consider Satisfaction Problem of Consumers Demands measured
by ordinary "Lebesgue measures'' in $R^{\infty}$ for various dynamical systems
in $R^{\infty}$. In order to solve this problem we use Liouville type theorems
for them which describes the dependence between initial and resulting measures
of the entire system.
