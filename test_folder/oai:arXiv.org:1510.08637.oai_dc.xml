 <dc:description>  We study a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with multiple seeds on a
regular random graph. Many researchers have studied the epidemic threshold of
epidemic models above which a global outbreak can occur, starting from an
infinitesimal fraction of seeds. However, there have been few studies of
epidemic models with finite fractions of seeds. The aim of this paper is to
clarify what happens in phase transitions in such cases. The SIR model in
networks exhibits two percolation transitions. We derive the percolation
transition points for the SIR model with multiple seeds to show that as the
infection rate increases epidemic clusters generated from each seed percolate
before a single seed can induce a global outbreak.
