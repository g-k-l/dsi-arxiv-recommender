 <dc:description>  Dynamics of driven dissipative Frenkel-Kontorova model is examined by using
largest Lyapunov exponent computational technique. Obtained results show that
besides the usual way where behavior of the system in the presence of external
forces is studied by analyzing its dynamical response function, the largest
Lyapunov exponent analysis can represent a very convenient tool to examine
system dynamics. In the dc driven systems, the critical depinning force for
particular structure could be estimated by computing the largest Lyapunov
exponent. In the dc+ac driven systems, if the substrate potential is the
standard sinusoidal one, calculation of the largest Lyapunov exponent offers a
more sensitive way to detect the presence of Shapiro steps. When the amplitude
of the ac force is varied the behavior of the largest Lyapunov exponent in the
pinned regime completely reflects the behavior of Shapiro steps and the
critical depinning force, in particular, it represents the mirror image of the
amplitude dependence of critical depinning force. This points out an advantage
of this technique since by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent in the
pinned regime we can get an insight into the dynamics of the system when
driving forces are applied.
