 <dc:description>  We consider a selfish variant of the knapsack problem. In our version, the
items are owned by agents, and each agent can misrepresent the set of items she
owns---either by avoiding reporting some of them (understating), or by
reporting additional ones that do not exist (overstating). Each agent's
objective is to maximize, within the items chosen for inclusion in the
knapsack, the total valuation of her own chosen items. The knapsack problem, in
this context, seeks to minimize the worst-case approximation ratio for social
welfare at equilibrium. We show that a randomized greedy mechanism has
attractive strategic properties: in general, it has a correlated price of
anarchy of $2$ (subject to a mild assumption). For overstating-only agents, it
becomes strategyproof; we also provide a matching lower bound of $2$ on the
(worst-case) approximation ratio attainable by randomized strategyproof
mechanisms, and show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism can provide
any constant approximation ratio. We also deal with more specialized
environments. For the case of $2$ understating-only agents, we provide a
randomized strategyproof $\frac{5+4\sqrt{2}}{7} \approx 1.522$-approximate
mechanism, and a lower bound of $\frac{5\sqrt{5}-9}{2} \approx 1.09$. When all
agents but one are honest, we provide a deterministic strategyproof
$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$-approximate mechanism with a matching
lower bound. Finally, we consider a model where agents can misreport their
items' properties rather than existence. Specifically, each agent owns a single
item, whose value-to-size ratio is publicly known, but whose actual value and
size are not. We show that an adaptation of the greedy mechanism is
strategyproof and $2$-approximate, and provide a matching lower bound; we also
show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism can provide a constant
approximation ratio.
