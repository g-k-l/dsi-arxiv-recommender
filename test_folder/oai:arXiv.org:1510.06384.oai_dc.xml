 <dc:description>  Real-time feedback from iterative electronic structure calculations requires
to mediate between the inherently unpredictable execution times of the
iterative algorithm employed and the necessity to provide data in fixed and
short time intervals for real-time rendering. We introduce the concept of a
mediator as a component able to deal with infrequent and unpredictable
reference data to generate reliable feedback. In the context of real-time
quantum chemistry, the mediator takes the form of a surrogate potential that
has the same local shape as the first-principles potential and can be evaluated
efficiently to deliver atomic forces as real-time feedback. The surrogate
potential is updated continuously by electronic structure calculations and
guarantees to provide a reliable response to the operator for any molecular
structure. To demonstrate the application of iterative electronic structure
methods in real-time reactivity exploration, we implement self-consistent
semi-empirical methods as the data source and apply the surrogate-potential
mediator to deliver reliable real-time feedback.
