 <dc:description>  We study the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in Pt grown $\textit{in situ}$
on CoFe$_2$O$_4$ (CFO) ferrimagnetic insulating (FMI) films. A careful analysis
of the angle-dependent and field-dependent longitudinal magnetoresistance
indicates that the SMR contains a contribution that does not follow the bulk
magnetization of CFO but it is a fingerprint of the complex magnetism at the
surface of the CFO layer, thus signaling SMR as a tool for mapping surface
magnetization. A systematic study of the SMR for different temperatures and CFO
thicknesses gives us information impossible to obtain with any standard
magnetometry technique. On one hand, surface magnetization behaves
independently of the CFO thickness and does not saturate up to high fields,
evidencing that the surface has its own anisotropy. On the other hand,
characteristic zero-field magnetization steps are not present at the surface
while they are relevant in the bulk, strongly suggesting that antiphase
boundaries are the responsible of such intriguing features. In addition, a
contribution from ordinary magnetoresistance of Pt is identified, which is only
distinguishable due to the low resistivity of the $\textit{in-situ}$ grown Pt.
