 <dc:description>  The D-term is, like mass and spin, a fundamental property related to the
energy-momentum tensor. Yet it is not known experimentally for any particle. In
all theoretical studies so far the D-terms of various particles were found
negative. Early works gave rise to the assumption the negative sign could be
related to stability. The emerging question is whether it is possible to find a
field-theoretical system with a positive D-term. To shed some light on this
question we investigate Q-clouds, an extreme parametric limit in the Q-ball
system. Q-clouds are classically unstable solutions which delocalize, spread
out over all space forming an infinitely dilute gas of free quanta, and are
even energetically unstable against tunneling to plane waves. In short, these
extremely unstable field configurations provide an ideal candidate system for
our purposes. By studying the energy-momentum tensor we show that at any stage
of the Q-cloud limit one deals with perfectly well-defined and, when viewed in
appropriately scaled coordinates, non-dissipating non-topological solitonic
solutions. We investigate in detail their properties, and find new physical
interpretations by observing that Q-clouds resemble BPS Skyrmions in certain
aspects, and correspond to universal non-perturbative solutions in (complex)
|\Phi|^4 theory. In particular, we show that also Q-cloud solutions have
negative D-terms. Our findings do not prove that D-terms must always be
negative. But they indicate that it is unlikely to realize a positive D-term in
a consistent physical system.
