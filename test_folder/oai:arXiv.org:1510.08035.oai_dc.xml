 <dc:description>  We present the overall conductance as well as the circulating currents in
individual loops of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) as we apply bias voltage via the
side attached electrodes. SPG being a self-similar structure, its manifestation
on loop currents and magnetic fields are examined in various generations of
this fractal and it has been observed that for a given configuration of the
electrodes, the physical quantities exhibit certain regularity as we go from
one generation to another. Also a notable feature is the introduction of
anisotropy in hopping causes an increase in magnitude of overall transport
current. These features are a subject of interest in this article.
