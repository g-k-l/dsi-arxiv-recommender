 <dc:description>  In this article we study the Kato problem for degenerate divergence form
operators. This was begun by Cruz-Uribe and Rios who proved that given an
operator $L_w=-w^{-1}{\rm div}(A\nabla)$, where $w\in A_2$ and $A$ is a
$w$-degenerate elliptic measure (i.e, $A=w\,B$ with $B$ an $n\times n$ bounded,
complex-valued, uniformly elliptic matrix), then $L_w$ satisfies the weighted
estimate $\|\sqrt{L_w}f\|_{L^2(w)}\approx\|\nabla f\|_{L^2(w)}$. Here we solve
the $L^2$-Kato problem: under some additional conditions on the weight $w$, the
following unweighted $L^2$-Kato estimates hold $$
\|L_w^{1/2}f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}\approx\|\nabla f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}. $$
  This extends the celebrated solution to the Kato conjecture by Auscher,
Hofmann, Lacey, McIntosh, and Tchamitchian, allowing the differential operator
to have some degeneracy in its ellipticity. For example, we consider the family
of operators $L_\gamma=-|x|^{\gamma}{\rm div}(|x|^{-\gamma}B(x)\nabla)$, where
$B$ is any bounded, complex-valued, uniformly elliptic matrix. We prove that
there exists $\epsilon&gt;0$, depending only on dimension and the ellipticity
constants, such that $$ \|L_\gamma^{1/2}f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}\approx\|\nabla
f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \qquad -\epsilon&lt;\gamma&lt;\frac{2\,n}{n+2}. $$ This
gives a range of $\gamma$'s for which the classical Kato square root $\gamma=0$
is an interior point.
  Our main results are obtained as a consequence of a rich Calder\'on-Zygmund
theory developed for some operators associated with $L_w$. These results, which
are of independent interest, establish estimates on $L^p(w)$, and also on
$L^p(v\,dw)$ with $v\in A_\infty(w)$, for the associated semigroup, its
gradient, the functional calculus, the Riesz transform, and square functions.
As an application, we solve some unweighted $L^2$-Dirichlet, Regularity and
Neumann boundary value problems for degenerate elliptic operators.
