 <dc:description>  We propose a mechanism where the under-doped regime of cuprate
superconductors is governed by an emergent SU(2) pseudo-spin symmetry
connecting the $d$-wave superconducting state to a $d$-wave charge order. The
specific SU(2) pairing fluctuations between the $d$-wave SC state and the
charge sector lead to the formation of a new state of matter, where local
patches of excitons are spontaneously generated and are responsible for the
creation of Fermi arcs in the pseudo-gap phase of cuprate superconductors. In
momentum space, each exciton patch is formed by a superposition of modulation
wave vectors coming from the anti-nodal region. A form factor contrives the
wave vectors to prefer the x and y axes, producing a typical checkerboard
structure recently observed in the under-doped regime. When the amplitude of
the new state vanishes, it becomes critical, and in this region a semiclassical
Boltzmann calculation leads to a $T/\ln(T)$ scaling of the resistivity in three
dimensions, which describes the strange-metal phase with its long-standing
linear-$T$ resistivity anomaly.
