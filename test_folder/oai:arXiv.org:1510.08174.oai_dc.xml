 <dc:description>  Segmentation of biomedical images is essential for studying and
characterizing anatomical structures, detection and evaluation of pathological
tissues. Segmentation has been further shown to enhance the reconstruction
performance in many tomographic imaging modalities by accounting for
heterogeneities of the excitation field and tissue properties in the imaged
region. This is particularly relevant in optoacoustic tomography, where
discontinuities in the optical and acoustic tissue properties, if not properly
accounted for, may result in deterioration of the imaging performance.
Efficient segmentation of optoacoustic images is often hampered by the
relatively low intrinsic contrast of large anatomical structures, which is
further impaired by the limited angular coverage of some commonly employed
tomographic imaging configurations. Herein, we analyze the performance of
active contour models for boundary segmentation in cross-sectional optoacoustic
tomography. The segmented mask is employed to construct a two compartment model
for the acoustic and optical parameters of the imaged tissues, which is
subsequently used to improve accuracy of the image reconstruction routines. The
performance of the suggested segmentation and modeling approach are showcased
in tissue-mimicking phantoms and small animal imaging experiments.
