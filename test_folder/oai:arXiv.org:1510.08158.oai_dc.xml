 <dc:description>  We consider the angle $\theta$ of inclination (with respect to the
horizontal) of the profile of a steady 2D inviscid symmetric periodic or
solitary water wave subject to gravity. Although $\theta$ may surpass
30$^\circ$ for some irrotational waves close to the extreme wave, Amick [Ami87]
proved that for any irrotational wave the angle must be less than
31.15$^\circ$. Is the situation similar for periodic or solitary waves that are
not irrotational? The extreme Gerstner wave has infinite depth, adverse
vorticity and vertical cusps ($\theta = 90^\circ$). Moreover, numerical
calculations show that even waves of finite depth can overturn if the vorticity
is adverse. In this paper, on the other hand, we prove an upper bound of
45$^\circ$ on $\theta$ for a large class of waves with favorable vorticity and
finite depth. In particular, the vorticity can be any constant with the
favorable sign. We also prove a series of general inequalities on the pressure
within the fluid, including the fact that any overturning wave must have a
pressure sink.
