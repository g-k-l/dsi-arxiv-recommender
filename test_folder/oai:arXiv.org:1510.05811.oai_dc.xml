 <dc:description>  In this paper we contribute a theoretical framework that sheds a new light on
the problem of microgrid analysis and control. The starting point is an energy
function comprising the kinetic energy associated with the elements that
emulate the rotating machinery and terms taking into account the reactive power
stored in the lines and dissipated on shunt elements. We then shape this energy
function with the addition of an adjustable voltage-dependent term, and
construct incremental storage functions satisfying suitable dissipation
inequalities. Our choice of the voltage-dependent term depends on the voltage
dynamics/controller under investigation. Several microgrids dynamics that have
similarities or coincide with dynamics already considered in the literature are
captured in our incremental energy analysis framework. The twist with respect
to existing results is that our incremental storage functions allow for a large
signal analysis of the coupled microgrid obviating the need for simplifying
linearization techniques and for the restrictive decoupling assumption in which
the frequency dynamics is fully separated from the voltage one. A complete
Lyapunov stability analysis of the various systems is carried out along with a
discussion on their active and reactive power sharing properties.
