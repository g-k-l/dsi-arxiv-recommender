 <dc:description>  Rotation-powered "recycled" millisecond pulsars are a variety of
rapidly-spinning neutron stars that typically show thermal X-ray radiation due
to the heated surface of their magnetic polar caps. Detailed numerical modeling
of the rotation-induced thermal X-ray pulsations observed from recycled
millisecond pulsars, including all relevant relativistic and stellar
atmospheric effects, has been identified as a promising approach towards an
astrophysical determination of the true neutron star mass-radius relation, and
by extension the state of cold matter at densities exceeding those of atomic
nuclei. Herein, I review the basic model and methodology commonly used to
extract information regarding neutron star structure from the pulsed X-ray
radiation observed from millisecond pulsars. I also summarize the results of
past X-ray observations of these objects and the prospects for precision
neutron star mass-radius measurements with the upcoming Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer (NICER) X-ray timing mission.
