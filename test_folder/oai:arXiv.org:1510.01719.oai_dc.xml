 <dc:description>  High formal valence Os-based double perovskites are a focus of current
interest because they display strong interplay of large spin orbit coupling and
strong electronic correlation. Here we present the electronic and magnetic
characteristics of a sequence of three cubic Os based double perovskites
Ba$_{2}$$A$OsO$_{6}$, ($A=$Na, Ca, Y), with formal valences (charge states) of
Os$^{+7}~(d^{1})$, Os$^{+6}(d^{2})$, Os$^{+5}(d^{3})$. For these first
principles based calculations we apply an ``exact exchange for correlated
electrons'' functional, with exact exchange applied in a hybrid fashion solely
to the Os($5d$) states. While Ba$_{2}$NaOsO$_{6}$ is a ferromagnetic Dirac-Mott
insulator studied previously, the other two show antiferromagnetic ordering
while all retain the cubic (undistorted) structure. For comparison purposes we
have investigated only the ferromagnetic ordered phase. A metal-insulator
transition is predicted to occur upon rotating the direction of magnetization
in all three materials, reflecting the central role of spin orbit coupling in
these small gap osmates. Surprises arising from comparing formal charge states
with the radial charge densities are discussed. Chemical shielding factors and
orbital susceptibilities are provided for comparison with future nuclear
magnetic resonance data.
