 <dc:description>  We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the adiabatic interaction of a
shock with a dense, spherical cloud. We compare how the nature of the
interaction changes with the Mach number of the shock, $M$, and the density
contrast of the cloud, $\chi$. We examine the differences with 2D axisymmetric
calculations, perform detailed resolution tests, and compare "inviscid" results
to those obtained with the inclusion of a $k$-$\epsilon$ subgrid turbulence
model. Resolutions of 32-64 cells per cloud radius are the minimum necessary to
capture the dominant dynamical processes in 3D simulations, while the 3D
inviscid and $k$-$\epsilon$ simulations typically show very good agreement.
Clouds accelerate and mix up to 5 times faster when they are poorly resolved.
The interaction proceeds very similarly in 2D and 3D - although non-azimuthal
modes lead to different behaviour, there is very little effect on key global
quantities such as the lifetime of the cloud and its acceleration. In
particular, we do not find significant differences in the hollowing or
"voiding" of the cloud between 2D and 3D simulations with $M=10$ and $\chi=10$,
which contradicts previous work in the literature.
