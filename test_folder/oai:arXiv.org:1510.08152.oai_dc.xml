 <dc:description>  We address the question of why strongly correlated d-wave superconductors,
such as the cuprates, prove to be surprisingly robust against the introduction
of non-magnetic impurities. We show that, very generally, both the
pair-breaking and the normal state transport scattering rates are significantly
suppressed by strong correlations effects arising in the proximity to a Mott
insulating state. We also show that the correlation-renormalized scattering
amplitude is generically enhanced in the forward direction, an effect which was
previously often ascribed to the specific scattering by charged impurities
outside the copper-oxide planes.
