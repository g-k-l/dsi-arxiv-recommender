 <dc:description>  Laser-induced magnetization precessional dynamics was investigated in
epitaxial films of Mn$_3$Ge, which is a tetragonal Heusler-like nearly
compensated ferrimagnet. The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) mode was observed,
the precession frequency for which exceeded 0.5 THz and originated from the
large magnetic anisotropy field of approximately 200 kOe for this ferrimagnet.
The effective damping constant was approximately 0.03. The corresponding
effective Landau-Lifshitz constant of approximately 60 Mrad/s and is comparable
to those of the similar Mn-Ga materials. The physical mechanisms for the
Gilbert damping and for the laser-induced excitation of the FMR mode were also
discussed in terms of the spin-orbit-induced damping and the laser-induced
ultrafast modulation of the magnetic anisotropy, respectively.
