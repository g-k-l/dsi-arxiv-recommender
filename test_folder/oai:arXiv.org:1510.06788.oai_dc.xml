 <dc:description>  Software interfaces today generally fall at either end of a spectrum. On one
end are programmable systems, which allow expert users (i.e. programmers) to
write software artifacts that describe complex abstractions, but programs are
disconnected from their eventual output. On the other end are domain-specific
graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which allow end users (i.e. non-programmers)
to easily create varied content but present insurmountable walls when a desired
feature is not built-in. Both programmatic and direct manipulation have
distinct strengths, but users must typically choose one over the other or use
some ad-hoc combination of systems. Our goal, put simply, is to bridge this
divide.
  We envision novel software systems that tightly couple programmatic and
direct manipulation --- a combination we dub prodirect manipulation --- for a
variety of use cases. This will require advances in a broad range of software
engineering disciplines, from program analysis and program synthesis technology
to user interface design and evaluation. In this extended abstract, we propose
two general strategies --- real-time program synthesis and domain-specific
synthesis of general-purpose programs --- that may prove fruitful for
overcoming the technical challenges. We also discuss metrics that will be
important in evaluating the usability and utility of prodirect manipulation
systems.
