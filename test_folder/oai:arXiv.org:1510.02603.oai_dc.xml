 <dc:description>  Hole-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductors below optimum doping have
small electron-like Fermi surfaces occupying a small fraction of the Brillouin
zone. There is strong evidence that this is linked to charge density wave (CDW)
order, which reconstructs the large hole-like Fermi surfaces predicted by band
structure calculations . Recent experiments have revealed the structure of the
two CDW components in the benchmark bilayer material YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ in
high field where quantum oscillation (QO) measurements are performed. We have
combined these results with a tight-binding description of the bands in an
isolated bilayer to give a minimal model revealing the essential physics of the
situation. Here we show that this approach, combined with the effects of
spin-orbit interactions and the pseudogap, gives a good qualitative description
of the multiple frequencies seen in the QO observations in this material.
Magnetic breakdown through weak CDW splitting of the bands will lead to a
field-dependence of the QO spectrum and to the observed fourfold symmetry of
the results in tilted fields.
