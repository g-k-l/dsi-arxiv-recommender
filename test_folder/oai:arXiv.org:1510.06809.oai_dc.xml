 <dc:description>  We show that equilibria of a sequential semi-anonymous nonatomic game (SSNG)
can be adopted by players in corresponding large but finite dynamic games to
achieve near-equilibrium payoffs. Such equilibria in the form of random
state-to-action rules are parsimonious in form and easy to execute, as they are
both oblivious of past history and blind to other players' present states. Our
transient results can be extended to a stationary case, where the finite
counterparts are special discounted stochastic games. The kind of equilibria we
adopt for SSNG are similar to distributional equilibria that are well
understood in literature, and they themselves are shown to exist.
