 <dc:description>  Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are a natural byproduct of galaxy
mergers. Previous studies have shown that flares from stellar tidal disruption
events (TDEs) are modified by the presence of a secondary perturber, causing
interruptions in the light curve. We study the dynamics of TDE debris in the
presence of a milliparsec-separated MBHB by integrating ballistic particle
orbits in the time-varying potential of the binary. We find that gaps in the
light curve appear when material misses the accretion radius on its first
return to pericentre. Subsequent recurrences can be decomposed into
"continuous" and "delayed" components, which exhibit different behaviour. We
find that this potential can substantially alter the locations of stream
self-intersections. When debris is confined to the plane, we find that close
encounters with the secondary BH leave noticeable signatures on the fallback
rate and can result in significant accretion onto the secondary BH. Tight,
equal-mass MBHBs accrete equally, periodically trading the infalling stream.
