 <dc:description>  The nonextensive thermodynamic relations are reexamined under the assumption
of temperature duality, which endows different senses to "physical temperature"
and "Lagrange temperature". Based on this assumption, two sets of parallel
Legendre transform structures are established. One is called "physical" set,
whose thermodynamic quantities are un-measurable in experiments, however are
important in theory. Another is called "Lagrange" set, whose quantities are
experimentally measurable. In the two formalisms, not only thermodynamic
quantities but also their thermodynamic relations are both liked through
Tsallis factor. The application of the two sets of thermodynamic relations
shows that the heat capacity defined in the classical gravitating
thermodynamics has no relevance to the stability of self-gravitating systems.
Instead, the sign of the recently defined heat capacity determines the
stability of self-gravitating systems.
