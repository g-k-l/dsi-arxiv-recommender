 <dc:description>  We present a potentially efficient dynamical formation scenario for Low Mass
X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) in the field, focusing on black-hole (BH) LMXBs. In this
formation channel LMXBs are formed from wide binaries $(&gt;1000$ AU) with a BH
component and a stellar companion. The wide binary is perturbed by fly-by's of
field stars and its orbit random-walks and changes over time. This diffusion
process can drive the binary into a sufficiently eccentric orbit such that the
binary components tidally interact at peri-center and the binary evolves to
become a short period binary, which eventually evolves into an LMXB. The
formation rate of LMXBs through this channel mostly depends on the number of
such BH wide binaries progenitors, which in turn depends on the velocity kicks
imparted to BHs (or NSs) at birth. We consider several models for the formation
and survival of such wide binaries, and calculate the LMXB formation rates for
each model. We find that models where BHs form through direct collapse with
no/little natal kicks can give rise to high formation rates comparable with
those inferred from observations. This formation scenario had several
observational signatures: (1) the number density of LMXBs generally follows the
background stellar density and (2) the mass function of the BH stellar
companion should be comparable to the mass function of the background stellar
population, likely peaking at $0.4-0.6$ M$_{\odot}$. The latter aspect, in
particular, is unique to this model compared with previously suggested LMXB
formation models following common envelope binary stellar evolution. We note
that NS LMXBs can similarly form from wide binaries, but their formation rate
through this channel is likely significantly smaller due to their much higher
natal kicks.
