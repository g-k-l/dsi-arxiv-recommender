 <dc:description>  The following issue is addressed: how the addition of a Gauss-Bonnet term
(generically coming from most fundamental theories, as string and M theories),
to a viable model, can change the specific properties, and even the physical
nature, of the corresponding cosmological solutions? Specifically, brand new
original dark energy models are obtained in this way with quite interesting
properties, which exhibit, in a unified fashion, the three distinguished
possible cosmological phases corresponding to phantom matter, quintessence, and
ordinary matter, respectively. A model, in which the equation of state
parameter, $w$, is a function of time, is seen to lead either to a singularity
of the Big Rip kind or to a bouncing solution which evolves into a de Sitter
universe with $w=-1$. Moreover, new Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity models with
bouncing behavior in the early stages of the universe evolution are obtained
and tested for the validity and stability of the corresponding solutions. They
allow for a remarkably natural, unified description of a bouncing behavior at
early times and accelerated expansion at present.
