 <dc:description>  We demonstrate the effectiveness of straightforward but never heretofore used
analysis of the complex 3D Fourier transform of galaxy coordinates derived from
redshift surveys. Numerical demonstrations of this approach are carried out on
a volume-limited sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey redshift survey. The
direct unbinned transform yields a complex 3D data cube quite similar to that
from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of finely binned galaxy positions. In
both cases deconvolution of the sampling window function yields estimates of
the true transform. Simple power spectrum estimates from these transforms are
roughly consistent with those using more sophisticated methods. However we
concentrate on the rarely studied Fourier phase spectrum, a simple and general
framework for characterizing non-Gaussianity, more easily interpretable than
the tangled, incomplete multi-point methods conventionally used. Supported by
modern large scale inference methodology, this approach casts a wider net than
one-parameter methods based on $F_{NL}$ for example.
