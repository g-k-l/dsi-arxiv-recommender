 <dc:description>  We study the Andrews-Gordon-Bressoud (AGB) generalisations of the
Rogers-Ramanujan q-series identities in the context of cylindric partitions. We
recall the definition of r-cylindric partitions, and provide a simple proof of
Borodin's product expression for their generating functions, that can be
regarded as a limiting case of an unpublished proof by Krattenthaler. We also
recall the relationships between the r-cylindric partition generating
functions, the principal characters of affine sl_r algebras, the M^{r, r+d}_r
minimal model characters of W_r algebras, and the r-string abaci generating
functions, as well as the relationships between them, providing simple proofs
for each.
  We then set r=2, and use 2-cylindric partitions to re-derive the AGB
identities as follows. Firstly, we use Borodin's product expression for the
generating functions of the 2-cylindric partitions with infinitely-long parts,
to obtain the product sides of the AGB identities, times a factor (q;
q)_{\infty}^{-1}, which is the generating function of ordinary partitions.
Next, we obtain a bijection from the 2-cylindric partitions, via 2-string
abaci, into decorated versions of Bressoud's restricted lattice paths.
Extending Bressoud's method of transforming between restricted paths that obey
different restrictions, we obtain sum expressions with manifestly non-negative
coefficients for the generating functions of the 2-cylindric partitions which
contains a factor (q; q)_{\infty}^{-1}. Equating the product and sum
expressions of the same 2-cylindric partitions, and canceling a factor of (q;
q)_{\infty}^{-1} on each side, we obtain the AGB identities.
