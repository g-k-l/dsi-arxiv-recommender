 <dc:description>  In this paper we determine new upper bounds for the maximal density of
translative packings of superballs in three dimensions (unit balls for the
$l^p_3$-norm) and of Platonic and Archimedean solids having tetrahedral
symmetry.
  These bounds give strong indications that some of the lattice packings of
superballs found in 2009 by Jiao, Stillinger, and Torquato are indeed optimal
among all translative packings. We improve Zong's recent upper bound for the
maximal density of translative packings of regular tetrahedra from
$0.3840\ldots$ to $0.3745\ldots$, getting closer to the best known lower bound
of $0.3673\ldots$
  We apply the linear programming bound of Cohn and Elkies which originally was
designed for the classical problem of packings of round spheres. The proofs of
our new upper bounds are computational and rigorous. Our main technical
contribution is the use of invariant theory of pseudo-reflection groups in
polynomial optimization.
