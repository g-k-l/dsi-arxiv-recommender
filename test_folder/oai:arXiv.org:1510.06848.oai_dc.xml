 <dc:description>  Firstly, we study the final masses of giant planets growing in protoplanetary
disks through capture of disk gas, by employing an empirical formula for the
gas capture rate and a shallow disk gap model, which are both based on
hydrodynamical simulations. The shallow disk gaps cannot terminate growth of
giant planets. For planets less massive than 10 Jupiter masses, their growth
rates are mainly controlled by the gas supply through the global disk
accretion, rather than their gaps. The insufficient gas supply compared with
the rapid gas capture causes a depletion of the gas surface density even at the
outside of the gap, which can create an inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.
Our model can also predict the depleted gas surface density in the inner hole
for a given planet mass. Secondly, our findings are applied to the formation of
our solar system. For the formation of Jupiter, a very low-mass gas disk with a
few or several Jupiter masses is required at the beginning of its gas capture
because of the non-stopping capture. Such a low-mass gas disk with sufficient
solid material can be formed through viscous evolution from an initially
$\sim$10AU-sized compact disk with the solar composition. By the viscous
evolution with a moderate viscosity of $\alpha \sim 10^{-3}$, most of disk gas
accretes onto the sun and a widely spread low-mass gas disk remains when the
solid core of Jupiter starts gas capture at $t \sim 10^7$ yrs. The depletion of
the disk gas is suitable for explaining the high metallicity in giant planets
of our solar system. A very low-mass gas disk also provides a plausible path
where type I and II planetary migrations are both suppressed significantly. In
particular, we also show that the type II migration of Jupiter-size planets
becomes inefficient because of the additional gas depletion due to the rapid
gas capture by themselves.
