 <dc:description>  Differential Evolution (DE) proved to be one of the most successful
evolutionary algorithms for global optimization purposes in continuous
problems. The core operator in DE is mutation which can provide the algorithm
with both exploration and exploitation. In this article, a new notation for DE
is proposed which has a formula that can be utilized for generating and
extracting novel mutations and by applying this new notation, four novel
mutations are proposed. More importantly, by combining these novel trial vector
generation strategies and four other well-known ones, we proposed Generalized
Mutation Differential Evolution (GMDE) that takes advantage of two mutation
pools that have both explorative and exploitative strategies inside them.
Results and experimental analysis are performed on CEC2005 benchmarks and the
results stated that GMDE is surprisingly competitive and significantly improved
the performance of this algorithm. Finally, GMDE is also applied to parameters
optimization, modification and improvement of a feature selection method for
cancer classification purposes over gene expression microarray profiles.
