 <dc:description>  It is shown that adiabatic cycles excite a quantum particle, which is
confined in a one-dimensional region and is initially in an eigenstate. During
the cycle, an infinitely sharp wall is applied and varied its strength and
position. After the completion of the cycle, the state of the particle arrives
another eigenstate. It is also shown that we may vary the final adiabatic state
by choosing the parameters of the cycle. With a combination of these adiabatic
cycles, we can connect an arbitrary pair of eigenstates. Hence, these cycles
may be regarded as basis of the adiabatic excitations. A detailed argument is
provided for the case that the particle is confined by an infinite square well.
This is an example of exotic quantum holonomy in Hamiltonian systems.
