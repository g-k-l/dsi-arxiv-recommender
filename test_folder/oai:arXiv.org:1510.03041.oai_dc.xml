 <dc:description>  For every $r \in \mathbb{N}$, let $\theta_r$ denote the graph with two
vertices and $r$ parallel edges. The $\theta_r$-girth of a graph $G$ is the
minimum number of edges of a subgraph of $G$ that can be contracted to
$\theta_r$. This notion generalizes the usual concept of girth which
corresponds to the case $r=2$. In [Minors in graphs of large girth, Random
Structures &amp; Algorithms, 22(2):213--225, 2003], K\"uhn and Osthus showed that
graphs of sufficiently large minimum degree contain clique-minors whose order
is an exponential function of their girth. We extend this result for the case
of $\theta_{r}$-girth and we show that the minimum degree can be replaced by
some connectivity measurement. As an application of our results, we prove that,
for every fixed $r$, graphs excluding as a minor the disjoint union of $k$
$\theta_{r}$'s have treewidth $O(k\cdot \log k)$.
