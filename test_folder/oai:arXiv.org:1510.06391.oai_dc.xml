 <dc:description>  Wallstrom's criticism of existing formulations of stochastic mechanics is
that they fail to derive quantum theory because they require an ad hoc
quantization condition on the postulated velocity potential, \emph{S}, in order
to derive single-valued Schr\"odinger wave functions. We propose an answer to
this criticism by modifying the Nelson-Yasue formulation of non-relativistic
stochastic mechanics for a spinless particle with the following hypothesis: a
spinless Nelson-Yasue particle of rest mass $m$ continuously undergoes a driven
mean oscillation of constant `zitterbewegung' (\emph{zbw}) frequency,
$\omega_{c}=\left(1/\hbar\right)mc^{2}$, in its mean rest frame. With this
hypothesis we show that, in the mean lab frame, \emph{S} arises as the mean
\emph{zbw} phase for an ensemble of such particles, satisfies the required
quantization condition, and evolves in time by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung
equations. The paper begins by reviewing Nelson-Yasue stochastic mechanics and
Wallstrom's criticism, after which we develop a classical model of a particle
of rest mass \emph{m} constrained to undergo the hypothesized \emph{zbw}
oscillation, with the purpose of making clear the physical assumptions of the
\emph{zbw} model without the added complications of stochastic mechanics. We
develop the classical model for the spinless one-particle case, without and
with field interactions, and then carry out the analogous developments for the
Nelson-Yasue version of this model. Using this `zitterbewegung stochastic
mechanics' (ZSM), we readily derive the single-valued wave functions of
non-relativistic quantum mechanics for a spinless particle in the analyzed
cases. We also apply ZSM to the case of a central potential and show that it
predicts angular momentum quantization. This paper sets the foundation for Part
II, which will (primarily) work out the many-particle version of ZSM.
