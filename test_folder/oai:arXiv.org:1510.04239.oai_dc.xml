 <dc:description>  We present a detailed discussion of the current theoretical and experimental
situation of the anomaly in the angular distribution of $B \to K^*(\to
K\pi)\mu^+\mu^-$, observed at LHCb in the $1~\text{fb}^{-1}$ dataset and
recently confirmed by the $3~\text{fb}^{-1}$ dataset. The impact of this data
and other recent measurements on $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ transitions
($\ell=e,\mu$) is considered. We review the observables of interest, focusing
on their theoretical uncertainties and their sensitivity to New Physics, based
on an analysis employing the QCD factorisation approach including several
sources of hadronic uncertainties (form factors, power corrections, charm-loop
effects). We perform fits to New Physics contributions including experimental
and theoretical correlations. The solution that we proposed in 2013 to solve
the $B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ anomaly, with a contribution ${\mathcal C}_9^{\rm
NP}\simeq -1$, is confirmed and reinforced. A wider range of New-Physics
scenarios with high significances (between 4 and 5 $\sigma$) emerges from the
fit, some of them being particularly relevant for model building. More data is
needed to discriminate among them conclusively. The inclusion of $b\to s e^+
e^-$ observables increases the significance of the favoured scenarios under the
hypothesis of New Physics breaking lepton flavour universality. Several tests
illustrate the robustness of our conclusions.
