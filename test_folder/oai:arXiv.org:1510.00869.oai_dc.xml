 <dc:description>  Wirelessly connected vehicles that exchange information about traffic
conditions can reduce delays caused by congestion. At a 2-to-1 lane reduction,
the improvement in flow past a bottleneck due to traffic with a random mixture
of 40% connected vehicles is found to be 52%. Control is based on
connected-vehicle-reported velocities near the bottleneck. In response to
indications of congestion the connected vehicles, which are also adaptive
cruise control vehicles, reduce their speed in slowdown regions. Early lane
changes of manually driven vehicles from the terminated lane to the continuous
lane are induced by the slowing connected vehicles. Self-organized congestion
at the bottleneck is thus delayed or eliminated, depending upon the incoming
flow magnitude. For the large majority of vehicles, travel times past the
bottleneck are substantially reduced. Control is responsible for delaying the
onset of congestion as the incoming flow increases. Adaptive cruise control
increases the flow out of the congested state at the bottleneck. The nature of
the congested state, when it occurs, appears to be similar under a variety of
conditions. Typically 80-100 vehicles are approximately equally distributed
between the lanes in the 500-m region prior to the end of the terminated lane.
Without the adaptive cruise control capability, connected vehicles can delay
the onset of congestion but do not increase the asymptotic flow past the
bottleneck. Calculations are done using the Kerner-Klenov stochastic
discrete-time model for manual vehicles. The dynamics of the connected vehicles
is given by a conventional adaptive cruise control algorithm plus commanded
deceleration. Because time in the model for manual vehicles is discrete
(one-second intervals), it is assumed that the acceleration of any vehicle
immediately in front of a connected vehicle is constant during the time
interval.
