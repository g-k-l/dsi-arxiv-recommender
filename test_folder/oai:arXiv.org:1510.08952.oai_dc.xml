 <dc:description>  We provide a novel analysis of Wald's sequential probability ratio test based
on information theoretic measures. This test is optimal in the sense that it
yields the minimum mean decision time. To analyze the decision-making process
we consider information densities enabling to represent the stochastic
information content of the observations yielding a stochastic termination time
of the test. We study the consequences of the optimality of the test on the
change of the information density in time. As a corollary, we find that the
optimality of the test implies that the conditional probability to decide for
hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_1$ (or the counter-hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_0$) given
that the test terminates at time instant $k$ is independent of time. Moreover,
we evaluate the evolution of the mutual information between the binary variable
to be tested and the decision variable of the Wald test.
