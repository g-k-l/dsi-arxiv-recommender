 <dc:description>  Quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory at low energies are
prominent instances of the combination of a short-range and a long-range
interaction. For the description of light nuclei, the large nucleon-nucleon
scattering lengths produced by the strong interaction, and the reduction of the
weak interaction to the Coulomb potential, play a crucial role. Helium-3 is the
first bound nucleus comprised of more than one proton in which this combination
of forces can be studied.
  We demonstrate a proper renormalization of Helium-3 using the pionless
effective field theory as the formal representation of the nuclear regime as
strongly interacting fermions. The theory is found consistent at leading and
next-to-leading order without isospin-symmetry-breaking 3-nucleon interactions
and a non-perturbative treatment of the Coulomb interaction. The conclusion
highlights the significance of the regularization method since a comparison to
previous work is contradictory if the difference in those methods is not
considered.
  With a perturbative Coulomb interaction, as suggested by dimensional
analysis, we find the Helium-3 system properly renormalized, too.
  For both treatments, renormalization-scheme independence of the effective
field theory is demonstrated by regulating the potential and a variation of the
associated cutoff.
