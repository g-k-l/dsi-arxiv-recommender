 <dc:description>  Computing entanglement entropy and its cousins is often challenging even in
the simplest continuum and lattice models, partly because such entropies depend
nontrivially on all geometric characteristics of the entangling region. Quantum
information measures between two or more regions are even more complicated, but
contain more, and universal, information. In this paper, we focus on R\'{e}nyi
entropy and information of the order $n=2$. For a free field theory, we show
that these quantities are mapped to the change of the thermodynamic free energy
by introducing boundaries subject to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions
in one higher dimension. This mapping allows us to exploit the powerful tools
available in the context of thermal Casimir effect, specifically a multipole
expansion suited for computing the R\'{e}nyi information between
arbitrarily-shaped regions. In particular, we compute the R\'{e}nyi information
between two disk-shaped regions at an arbitrary separation distance. We provide
an alternative representation of the R\'{e}nyi information as a sum over
closed-loop polymers, which establishes a connection to purely entropic
effects, and proves useful in deriving information inequalities. Finally, we
discuss extensions of our results beyond free field theories.
