 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the stability of light traffic achieved by a
scheduling algorithm which is suitable for heterogeneous traffic networks.
Since analyzing a scheduling algorithm is intractable using the conventional
mathematical tool, our goal is to minimize the largest queue-overflow
probability achieved by the algorithm. In the large deviation setting, this
problem is equivalent to maximizing the asymptotic decay rate of the largest
queue-overflow probability. We first derive an upper bound on the decay rate of
the queue overflow probability as the queue overflow threshold approaches
infinity. Then, we study several structural properties of the minimum-cost-path
to overflow of the queue with the largest length, which is basically equivalent
to the decay rate of the largest queue-overflow probability. Given these
properties, we prove that the queue with the largest length follows a sample
path with linear increment. For certain parameter value, the scheduling
algorithm is asymptotically optimal in reducing the largest queue length.
Through numerical results, we have shown the large deviation properties of the
queue length typically used in practice while varying one parameter of the
algorithm.
