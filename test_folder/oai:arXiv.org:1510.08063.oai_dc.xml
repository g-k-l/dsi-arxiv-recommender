 <dc:description>  In the context of Self-Interacting Dark Matter as a solution for the
small-scale structure problems, we consider the possibility that Dark Matter
could have been produced without being in thermal equilibrium with the Standard
Model bath. We discuss one by one the following various dark matter production
regimes of this kind: freeze-in, reannihilation and dark freeze-out. We
exemplify how these mechanisms work in the context of the particularly simple
Hidden Vector Dark Matter model. In contrast to scenarios where there is
thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model bath, we find two regimes which can
easily satisfy all the laboratory and cosmological constraints. These are dark
freeze-out with 3-to-2 annihilations and freeze-in via a light mediator. In the
first regime, different temperatures in the visible and the Dark Matter sectors
allow us to avoid the constraints coming from cosmic structure formation as
well as the use of non-perturbative couplings to reproduce the observed relic
density. For the second regime, different couplings are responsible for Dark
Matter relic density and self-interactions, permitting to surpass BBN, X-ray,
CMB and direct detection constraints.
