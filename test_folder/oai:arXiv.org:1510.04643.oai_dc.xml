 <dc:description>  Nucleosynthesis, light curves, explosion energies, and remnant masses are
calculated for a grid of supernovae resulting from massive stars with solar
metallicity and masses from 9.0 to 120 solar masses. The full evolution is
followed using an adaptive reaction network of up to 2000 nuclei. A novel
aspect of the survey is the use of a one-dimensional neutrino transport model
for the explosion. This explosion model has been calibrated to give the
observed energy for SN 1987A, using several standard progenitors, and for the
Crab supernova using a 9.6 solar mass progenitor. As a result of using a
calibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the supernova is
variable and sensitive to the structure of the presupernova star. Many
progenitors with extended core structures do not explode, but become black
holes, and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set.
The resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the sun provided that
a reasonable contribution from Type Ia supernovae is also allowed, but with a
deficiency of light s-process isotopes. The resulting neutron star IMF has a
mean gravitational mass near 1.4 solar masses. The average black hole mass is
about 9 solar masses if only the helium core implodes, and 14 solar masses if
the entire presupernova star collapses. Only ~10% of supernovae come from stars
over 20 solar masses and some of these are Type Ib or Ic. Some useful
systematics of Type IIp light curves are explored.
