 <dc:description>  We study statistics of the gaps in Random Average Process (RAP) on a ring
with particles hopping symmetrically, except one tracer particle which could be
driven. These particles hop either to the left or to the right by a random
fraction $\eta$ of the space available till next particle in the respective
directions. The random fraction $\eta \in [0,~1)$ is chosen from a distribution
$R(\eta)$. For non-driven tracer, when $R(\eta)$ satisfies a necessary and
sufficient condition, the stationary joint distribution of the gaps between
successive particles takes an universal form that is factorized except for a
global constraint. Some interesting explicit forms of $R(\eta)$ are found which
satisfy this condition. In case of driven tracer, the system reaches a
current-carrying steady state where such factorization does not hold.
Analytical progress has been made in the thermodynamic limit, where we computed
the single site mass distribution inside the bulk. We have also computed the
two point gap-gap correlation exactly in that limit. Numerical simulations
support our analytical results.
