 <dc:description>  This article is concerned with an example of complex planar geometry arising
from flat origami challenges. The complexity of solution algorithms is
illustrated, depending on the depth of the initial analysis of the problem,
starting from brute force enumeration, up to the equivalence to a dedicated
problem in graph theory. This leads to algorithms starting from an untractable
case on modern computers, up to a run of few seconds on a portable personal
computer. This emphasizes the need for a prior analysis by humans before
considering the assistance of computers for complex design problems. The graph
problem is an enumeration of spanning trees from a grid graph, leading to a
coarse scale description of the topology of the paper edge on the flat-folded
state.
