 <dc:description>  The origin of the ultra-high-energy particles we receive on the Earth from
the outer space such as EeV cosmic rays and PeV neutrinos remains an enigma.
All mechanisms known to us currently make use of electromagnetic interaction to
accelerate charged particles. In this paper we propose a mechanism exclusively
based on gravity rather than electromagnetic interaction. We show that it is
possible to generate ultra-high-energy particles starting from particles with
moderate energies using the collisional Penrose process in an overspinning Kerr
spacetime transcending the Kerr bound only by an infinitesimal amount, i.e.,
with the Kerr parameter $a=M(1+\epsilon)$, where we take the limit $\epsilon
\rightarrow 0^+$. We consider two massive particles starting from rest at
infinity that collide at $r=M$ with divergent center-of-mass energy and produce
two massless particles. We show that massless particles produced in the
collision can escape to infinity with the ultra-high energies exploiting the
collisional Penrose process with the divergent efficiency $\eta \sim
{1}/{\sqrt{\epsilon}} \rightarrow \infty$. Assuming the isotropic emission of
massless particles in the center-of-mass frame of the colliding particles, we
show that half of the particles created in the collisions escape to infinity
with the divergent energies. To a distant observer, ultra-high-energy particles
appear to originate from a bright spot which is at the angular location $\xi
\sim {2M}/{r_{obs}}$ with respect to the singularity on the side which is
rotating towards the observer. We show that the anisotropy in emission in the
center-of-mass frame, which is dictated by the differential cross-section of
underlying particle physics process, leaves a district signature on the
spectrum of ultra-high-energy massless particles. Thus, it provides a unique
probe into fundamental particle physics.
