 <dc:description>  The Fermi/LAT instrument has detected about two thousands Extragalactic High
Energy (E &gt; 100 MeV) gamma-ray sources. One of the brightest is 3FGL
1603.9-4903, associated to the radio source PMN J1603-4904. Its nature is not
yet clear, it could be either a very peculiar BL Lac or a CSO (Compact
Symmetric Object) radio source, considered as the early stage of a radio
galaxy. The latter, if confirmed, would be the first detection in gamma-rays
for this class of objects. Recently a redshift z=0.18 +/- 0.01 has been claimed
on the basis of the detection of a single X-ray line at 5.44 +/- 0.05 keV
interpreted as a 6.4 keV (rest frame) fluorescent line. We aim to investigate
the nature of 3FGL 1603.9-4903/PMN J1603-4904 using optical to NIR
spectroscopy. We observed PMN J1603-4904 with the UV-NIR VLT/X-shooter
spectrograph for two hours. We extracted spectra in the VIS and NIR range that
we calibrated in flux and corrected for telluric absorption and we
systematically searched for absorption and emission features. The source was
detected starting from ~6300 Ang down to 24000 Ang with an intensity comparable
to the one of its 2MASS counterpart and a mostly featureless spectrum. The
continuum lacks absorption features and thus is non-stellar in origin and
likely non-thermal. On top of this spectrum we detected three emission lines
that we interpret as the Halpha-[NII] complex, the [SII] 6716,6731 doublet and
the [SIII] 9530 line, obtaining a redshift estimate of z= 0.2321 +/- 0.0004.
The equivalent width of the Halpha-[NII] complex implies that PMN J1603-4904
does not follow the observational definition of BL Lac, the line ratios suggest
that a LINER/Seyfert nucleus is powering the emission. This new redshift
measurement implies that the X-ray line previously detected should be
interpreted as a 6.7 keV line which is very peculiar.
