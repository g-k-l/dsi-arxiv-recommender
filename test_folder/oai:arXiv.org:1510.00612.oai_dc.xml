 <dc:description>  We report on the formation of critical states in disordered graphene, at the
origin of variable and unconventional transport properties in the quantum Hall
regime, such as a zero-energy Hall conductance plateau in the absence of an
energy bandgap and Landau level degeneracy breaking. By using efficient
real-space transport methodologies, we compute both the dissipative and Hall
conductivities of large size graphene sheets with random distribution of model
single and double vacancies. By analyzing the scaling of transport coefficients
with defect density, system size and magnetic length, we elucidate the origin
of anomalous quantum Hall features as magnetic-field dependent impurity states,
which percolate at some critical energies. These findings shed light on
unidentified states and quantum transport anomalies reported experimentally.
