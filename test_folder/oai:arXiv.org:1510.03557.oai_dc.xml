 <dc:description>  The article presents an efficient image reconstruction algorithm for single
scattering optical tomography (SSOT) in circular geometry of data acquisition.
This novel medical imaging modality uses photons of light that scatter once in
the body to recover its interior features. The mathematical model of SSOT is
based on the broken ray (or V-line Radon) transform (BRT), which puts into
correspondence to an image function its integrals along V-shaped piecewise
linear trajectories. The process of image reconstruction in SSOT requires
inversion of that transform.
  We implement numerical inversion of a broken ray transform in a disc with
partial radial data. Our method is based on a relation between the Fourier
coefficients of the image function and those of its BRT recently discovered by
Ambartsoumian and Moon. The numerical algorithm requires solution of
ill-conditioned matrix problems, which is accomplished using a half-rank
truncated singular value decomposition method. Several numerical computations
validating the inversion formula are presented, which demonstrate the accuracy,
speed and robustness of our method in the case of both noise-free and noisy
data.
