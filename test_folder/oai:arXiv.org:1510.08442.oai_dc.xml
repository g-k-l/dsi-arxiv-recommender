 <dc:description>  We present a comprehensive discussion of renormalisation of 3-point functions
of scalar operators in conformal field theories in general dimension. We have
previously shown that conformal symmetry uniquely determines the momentum-space
3-point functions in terms of certain integrals involving a product of three
Bessel functions (triple-K integrals). The triple-K integrals diverge when the
dimensions of operators satisfy certain relations and we discuss how to obtain
renormalised 3-point functions in all cases. There are three different types of
divergences: ultralocal, semilocal and nonlocal, and a given divergent triple-K
integral may have any combination of them. Ultralocal divergences may be
removed using local counterterms and this results in new conformal anomalies.
Semilocal divergences may be removed by renormalising the sources, and this
results in CFT correlators that satisfy Callan-Symanzik equations with beta
functions. In the case of non-local divergences, it is the triple-K
representation that is singular, not the 3-point function. Here, the CFT
correlator is the coefficient of the leading nonlocal singularity, which
satisfies all the expected conformal Ward identities. Such correlators exhibit
enhanced symmetry: they are also invariant under dual conformal transformations
where the momenta play the role of coordinates. When both anomalies and beta
functions are present the correlators exhibit novel analytic structure
containing products of logarithms of momenta. We illustrate our discussion with
numerous examples, including free field realisations and AdS/CFT computations.
