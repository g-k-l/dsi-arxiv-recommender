 <dc:description>  Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) represent a remarkable advance in high
energy particle detection, since they provide a moderate increase (gain ~10) of
the collected charge, thus leading to a notable improvement of the
signal-to-noise ratio, which largely extends the possible application of
Silicon detectors beyond their present working field. The optimum detection
performance requires a careful implementation of the multiplication junction,
in order to obtain the desired gain on the read out signal, but also a proper
design of the edge termination and the peripheral region, which prevents the
LGAD detectors from premature breakdown and large leakage current. This work
deals with the critical technological aspects when optimising the LGAD
structure. The impact of several design strategies for the device periphery is
evaluated with the aid of TCAD simulations, and compared with the experimental
results obtained from the first LGAD prototypes fabricated at the IMB-CNM clean
room. Solutions for the peripheral region improvement are also provided.
