 <dc:description>  The Adams spectral sequence is available in any triangulated category
equipped with a projective or injective class. Higher Toda brackets can also be
defined in a triangulated category, as observed by B. Shipley based on J.
Cohen's approach for spectra. We provide a family of definitions of higher Toda
brackets, show that they are equivalent to Shipley's, and show that they are
self-dual. Our main result is that the Adams differential $d_r$ in any Adams
spectral sequence can be expressed as an $(r+1)$-fold Toda bracket and as an
$r^{\text{th}}$ order cohomology operation. We also show how the result
simplifies under a sparseness assumption, discuss several examples, and give an
elementary proof of a result of Heller, which implies that the three-fold Toda
brackets in principle determine the higher Toda brackets.
