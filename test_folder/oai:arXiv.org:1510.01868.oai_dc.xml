 <dc:description>  Using a variant of Schreier's Theorem, and the theory of Green's relations,
we show how to reduce the computation of an arbitrary subsemigroup of a finite
regular semigroup to that of certain associated subgroups. Examples of
semigroups to which these results apply include many important classes:
transformation semigroups, partial permutation semigroups and inverse
semigroups, partition monoids, matrix semigroups, and subsemigroups of finite
regular Rees matrix and $0$-matrix semigroups over groups. For any subsemigroup
of such a semigroup, it is possible to, among other things, efficiently compute
its size and Green's relations, test membership, factorize elements over the
generators, find the semigroup generated by the given subsemigroup and any
collection of additional elements, calculate the partial order of the
$\mathscr{D}$-classes, test regularity, and determine the idempotents. This is
achieved by representing the given subsemigroup without exhaustively
enumerating its elements. It is also possible to compute the Green's classes of
an element of such a subsemigroup without determining the global structure of
the semigroup.
