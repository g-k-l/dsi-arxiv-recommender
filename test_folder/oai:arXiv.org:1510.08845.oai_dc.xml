 <dc:description>  We study energy flows in geometrically thick accretion discs, both optically
thick and thin, using general relativistic, three-dimensional simulations of
black hole accretion flows. We find that for non-rotating black holes the
efficiency of the total feedback from thick accretion discs is $3\%$ - roughly
half of the thin disc efficiency. This amount of energy is ultimately
distributed between outflow and radiation, the latter scaling weakly with the
accretion rate for super-critical accretion rates, and returned to the
interstellar medium. Accretion on to rotating black holes is more efficient
because of the additional extraction of rotational energy. However, the jet
component is collimated and likely to interact only weakly with the
environment, whereas the outflow and radiation components cover a wide solid
angle.
