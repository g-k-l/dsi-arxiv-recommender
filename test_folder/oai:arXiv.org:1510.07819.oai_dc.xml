 <dc:description>  Predicting missing links in incomplete complex networks efficiently and
accurately is still a challenging problem. The recently proposed CAR
(Cannistrai-Alanis-Ravai) index shows the power of local link/triangle
information in improving link-prediction accuracy. With the information of
level-2 links, which are links between common-neighbors, most classical
similarity indices can be improved. Nevertheless, calculating the number of
level-2 links makes CAR index not efficient enough. Inspired by the idea of
employing local link/triangle information, we propose a new similarity index
with more local structure information. In our method, local link/triangle
structure information can be conveyed by clustering coefficient of common
neighbors directly. The reason why clustering coefficient has good
effectiveness in estimating the contribution of a common-neighbor is because
that it employs links existing between neighbors of the common-neighbor and
these links have the same structural position with the candidate link to this
common-neighbor. Ten real-world networks drawn from five various fields are
used to test the performance of our method against to classical similarity
indices and recently proposed CAR index. Two estimators: precision and AUP, are
used to evaluate the accuracy of link prediction algorithms. Generally
speaking, our new index only performs competitively with CAR, but it is a good
complement to CAR for networks with not very high LCP-corr, which is a measure
to estimate the correlation between number of common-neighbors and number of
links between common-neighbors. Besides, the proposed index is also more
efficient than CAR index.
