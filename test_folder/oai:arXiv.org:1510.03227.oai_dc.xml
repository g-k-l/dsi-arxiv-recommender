 <dc:description>  The decision problems on matrices were intensively studied for many decades
as matrix products play an essential role in the representation of various
computational processes. However, many computational problems for matrix
semigroups are inherently difficult to solve even for problems in low
dimensions and most matrix semigroup problems become undecidable in general
starting from dimension three or four.
  This paper solves two open problems about the decidability of the vector
reachability problem over a finitely generated semigroup of matrices from
$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and the point to point reachability (over rational
numbers) for fractional linear transformations, where associated matrices are
from $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. The approach to solving reachability problems
is based on the characterization of reachability paths between points which is
followed by the translation of numerical problems on matrices into
computational and combinatorial problems on words and formal languages. We also
give a geometric interpretation of reachability paths and extend the
decidability results to matrix products represented by arbitrary labelled
directed graphs. Finally, we will use this technique to prove that a special
case of the scalar reachability problem is decidable.
