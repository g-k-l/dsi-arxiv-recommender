 <dc:description>  A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy of The Australian
National University.
  In this work we introduce several new optimisation methods for problems in
machine learning. Our algorithms broadly fall into two categories: optimisation
of finite sums and of graph structured objectives. The finite sum problem is
simply the minimisation of objective functions that are naturally expressed as
a summation over a large number of terms, where each term has a similar or
identical weight. Such objectives most often appear in machine learning in the
empirical risk minimisation framework in the non-online learning setting. The
second category, that of graph structured objectives, consists of objectives
that result from applying maximum likelihood to Markov random field models.
Unlike the finite sum case, all the non-linearity is contained within a
partition function term, which does not readily decompose into a summation.
  For the finite sum problem, we introduce the Finito and SAGA algorithms, as
well as variants of each.
  For graph-structured problems, we take three complementary approaches. We
look at learning the parameters for a fixed structure, learning the structure
independently, and learning both simultaneously. Specifically, for the combined
approach, we introduce a new method for encouraging graph structures with the
"scale-free" property. For the structure learning problem, we establish
SHORTCUT, a O(n^{2.5}) expected time approximate structure learning method for
Gaussian graphical models. For problems where the structure is known but the
parameters unknown, we introduce an approximate maximum likelihood learning
algorithm that is capable of learning a useful subclass of Gaussian graphical
models.
