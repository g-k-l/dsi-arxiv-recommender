 <dc:description>  Low mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies are key objects for our understanding of
the chemical evolution of the pristine Universe and the Local Group of
galaxies. Abundance ratios in stars of these objects can be used to better
understand their star formation and chemical evolution. We report on the
analysis of a sample of 11 stars belonging to 5 different ultra faint dwarf
spheroidal galaxies (UfDSph) based on X-Shooter spectra obtained at the VLT.
Medium resolution spectra have been used to determine the detailed chemical
composition of their atmosphere. We performed a standard 1D LTE analysis to
compute the abundances.
  Considering all the stars as representative of the same population of low
mass galaxies, we found that the [alpha/Fe] ratios vs [Fe/H] decreases as the
metallicity of the star increases in a way similar to what is found for the
population of stars belonging to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The main difference
is that the solar [alpha/Fe] is reached at a much lower metallicity for the
UfDSph than the dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
  We report for the first time the abundance of strontium in CVnI. The star we
analyzed in this galaxy has a very high [Sr/Fe] and a very low upper limit of
barium which makes it a star with an exceptionally high [Sr/Ba] ratio.
  Our results seem to indicate that the galaxies which have produced the bulk
of their stars before the reionization (fossil galaxies) have lower [X/Fe]
ratios at a given metallicity than the galaxies that have experienced a
discontinuity in their star formation rate (quenching).
