 <dc:description>  This paper develops a systematic treatment of monotonicity-based pathwise
dualities for Markov processes taking values in partially ordered sets. We show
that every Markov process that takes values in a finite partially ordered set
and whose generator can be represented in monotone maps has a pathwise dual
process. In the special setting of attractive spin systems this has been
discovered earlier by Gray.
  We show that the dual simplifies a lot when the state space is a lattice (in
the order-theoretic meaning of the word) and all monotone maps satisfy an
additivity condition. This leads to a unified treatment of several well-known
dualities, including Siegmund's dual for processes with a totally ordered state
space, duality of additive spin systems, and a duality due to Krone for the
two-stage contact process, and allows for the construction of new dualities as
well.
  We show that the well-known representation of additive spin systems in terms
of open paths in a graphical representation can be generalized to additive
Markov processes taking values in general lattices, but for the process and its
dual to be representable on the same underlying space, we need to assume that
the lattice is distributive.
  In the final section, we show how our results can be generalized from finite
state spaces to interacting particle systems with finite local state spaces.
