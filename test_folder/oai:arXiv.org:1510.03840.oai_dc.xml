 <dc:description>  A novel optimization algorithm, called accelerated particle swarm
optimization (APSO), is proposed for dynamic spectrum sensing in cognitive
radio networks. While modified swarm-based optimization algorithms focus on
slight variations of the standard mathematical formulas, in APSO, the
acceleration variable of the particles in the swarm is also considered in the
search space of the optimization problem. We show that the proposed APSO-based
dynamic spectrum sensing technique is more efficient than existing methods,
which are entirely based on the original particle swarm optimization algorithm.
