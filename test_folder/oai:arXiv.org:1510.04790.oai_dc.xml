 <dc:description>  The Majorana neutrino in type-I seesaw and the pseudo-Dirac neutrinos in the
inverse seesaw can have sizable mixings with the light neutrinos in the
standard model (SM), through which the heavy neutrinos can be produced at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In producing the heavy neutrinos we study a
variety of initial states such as quark-quark, quark-gluon and gluon-gluon as
well as photon mediated processes. For the Majorana heavy neutrino production
we consider same-sign di-lepton plus di-jet as the signal events. Using the
recent ATLAS and CMS data at $\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV with 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ and 19.7
fb$^{-1}$ luminosities, respectively, we obtain direct upper bounds on the
light-heavy neutrino mixing angles. For the pseudo-Dirac heavy neutrino
production we consider the final sate with tri-lepton plus missing energy as
the signal events. Using the recent anomalous multi-lepton search by CMS at
$\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV with 19.5 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity we obtain upper bounds on the
mixing angles. Taking the varieties of initial states into account, the
previously obtained upper bounds on the mixing angles have been improved. We
scale our results at the 8 TeV LHC to obtain a prospective search reach at the
14 TeV LHC with high luminosities.
