 <dc:description>  We present the R-package mgm for the estimation of both stationary and
time-varying mixed graphical models and mixed vector autoregressive models in
high-dimensional data. Variables of mixed type (continuous, count, categorical)
are ubiquitous in datasets in many disciplines, however, available methods
cannot incorporate (nominal) categorical variables and suffer from possible
information loss due to transformations of non-Gaussian continuous variables.
In addition, we extend both models to the time-varying case in which the true
model changes over time, under the assumption that change is a smooth function
of time. Time-varying models offer a rich description of temporally evolving
systems as they provide information about organizational processes, information
diffusion, vulnerabilities and the potential impact of interventions. Next to
introducing the theory of the implemented methods and explaining the software
package, we provide performance benchmarks and applications to two medical
datasets.
