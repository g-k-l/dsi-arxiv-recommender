 <dc:description>  In the last few years, several criteria to identify Eistein-Podolski-Rosen
steering have been proposed and experimentally implemented. On the operational
side, however, the evaluation of the steerability degree of a given state has
shown to be a difficult task and only a few results are known. In this work, we
propose a measure of steering that is based on the maximal violation of well
established steering inequalities. Applying this approach to two-qubit states,
we managed to derive simple closed formulas for steering in the two- and
three-measurement scenarios. Among the options investigated, a measure has been
found that correctly satisfies the entanglement-steering-nonlocality hierarchy
and reproduces results reported so far.
