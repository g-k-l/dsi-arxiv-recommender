 <dc:description>  This paper extends the classic cake-cutting problem to a situation in which
the "cake" is divided among families. Each piece of cake is owned and used
simultaneously by all members of the family. A typical example of such a cake
is land. We examine three ways to assess the fairness of such a division, based
on the classic proportionality criterion: (a) Average proportionality means
that for each family, the value of its share averaged over all family members
is at least 1/k (where k is the number of families); (b) Unanimous
proportionality means that in each family, each member values the family's
share as at least 1/k; (c) Democratic proportionality means that in each
family, at least half the members value the family's share as at least 1/k. We
compare these criteria based on the number of connected components in the
resulting division.
