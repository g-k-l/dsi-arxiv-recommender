 <dc:description>  A metallic disk with strong spin orbit interaction is investigated . The
finite disk geometry introduces a confining potential. Due to the strong
spin-orbit interaction and confining potential the metal disk is described by
an effective one dimensional with a harmonic potential. The harmonic potential
gives rise to classical turning points. As a result open boundary conditions
must be used. We Bosonize the model and obtain chiral Bosons for each spin on
the edge of the disk. When the filling fraction is reduced to
$\nu=\frac{k_{F}}{k_{so}}=\frac{1}{3}$ the electron- electron interactions are
studied using the Jordan Wigner phase for composite fermions which gives rise
to a Luttinger liquid. When the metallic disk is in the proximity with a
superconductor a Fractional Topological Insulators is obtained.
  An experimental realization is proposed. We show that by tunning the chemical
potential we control the classical turning points for which a Fractional
Topological Insulator is realized.
