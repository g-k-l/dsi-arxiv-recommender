 <dc:description>  This article addresses the problem of derivative-free (single- or
multi-objective) optimization subject to multiple inequality constraints. Both
the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be smooth, non-linear and
expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that can be
used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial
design optimization problems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty
has its roots in both the Bayesian and the multi-objective optimization
literatures. More specifically, an extended domination rule is used to handle
objectives and constraints in a unified way, and a corresponding expected
hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion is proposed. This new criterion is
naturally adapted to the search of a feasible point when none is available, and
reduces to existing Bayesian sampling criteria---the classical Expected
Improvement (EI) criterion and some of its constrained/multi-objective
extensions---as soon as at least one feasible point is available. The
calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequential
Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, an algorithm similar to the subset
simulation method, which is well known in the field of structural reliability,
is used to estimate the criterion. The method, which we call BMOO (for Bayesian
Multi-Objective Optimization), is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for
single- and multi-objective constrained optimization.
