 <dc:description>  Spin glass (SG) is a typical magnetic system with frozen random spin
orientation at low temperatures. The system exhibits rich physical properties,
such as infinite number of ground states, memory effect and aging phenomena.
There are two main ingredients considered to be pivotal for the existence of SG
behavior, namely, frustration and randomness. For the canonical SG system,
frustration is led by the presence of competing interaction between
ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) couplings. Previously, Bartolozzi
{\it et al.} [ Phys. Rev. B{\bf 73}, 224419 (2006)], reported the SG properties
of the AF Ising spins on scale free network (SFN). It is a new type of SG,
different from the canonical one which requires the presence of both FM and AF
couplings. In this new system, frustration is purely caused by the topological
factor and its randomness is related to the irregular connectvity. Recently,
Surungan {\it et. al.} [Journal of Physics: Conference Series 640, 012001
(2015)] reported SG bahavior of AF Heisenberg model on SFN. We further
investigate this type of system by studying an AF Heisenberg model on rewired
square lattices. We used Replica Exchange algorithm of Monte Carlo Method and
calculated the SG order parameter to search for the existence of SG phase.
