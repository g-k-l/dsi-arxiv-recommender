 <dc:description>  We calculate the properties of excited charm and charm-strange mesons. We use
the relativized quark model to calculate their masses and wavefunctions that
are used to calculate radiative transition partial widths and the $^3P_0$
quark-pair-creation model to calculate their strong decay widths. We use these
results to make quark model spectroscopic assignments for recently observed
charm and charm-strange mesons. In particular we find that the properties of
the $D_J(2550)^0$ and $D_J^*(2600)^0$ are consistent with those of the
$2^1S_0(c\bar{u})$ and the $2^3S_1(c\bar{u})$ states respectively, the
$D_1^*(2760)^0$, $D_3^*(2760)^-$, and $D_J(2750)^0$ with those of the
$1^3D_1(c\bar{u})$, $1^3D_3(d\bar{c})$, and $1D_2(c\bar{u})$ states
respectively. We tentatively identify the $D^*_J(3000)^0$ as the
$1^3F_4(c\bar{u})$ and favour the $D_J(3000)^0$ to be the $3^1S_0(c\bar{u})$
although we do not rule out the $1F_3$ and $1F_3'$ assignment. For the recently
observed charm-strange mesons we identify the $D_{s1}^*(2709)^\pm$,
$D_{s1}^*(2860)^-$, and $D_{s3}^*(2860)^-$ as the $2^3S_1(c\bar{s})$,
$1^3D_1(s\bar{c})$, and $1^3D_3(s\bar{c})$ states respectively and suggest that
the $D_{sJ}(3044)^\pm$ is most likely the $D_{s1}(2P_1')$ or $D_{s1}(2P_1)$
states although it might be the $D_{s2}^*(2^3P_2)$ with the $DK$ final state
too small to be observed with current statistics. Based on the predicted
properties of excited states, that they not have too large a total width and
they have a reasonable branching ratio to simple final states, we suggest
states that should be able to be found in the near future. We expect that the
tables of properties summarizing our results will be useful for interpreting
future observations of charm and charm-strange mesons.
