 <dc:description>  We analyze the error estimates of finite element approximations for a
Dirichlet boundary problem with a white or colored Gaussian noise. The
covariance operator of the proposed noise need not to be commutative with
Dirichlet Laplacian. Through the convergence analysis for a sequence of
approximate solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with
the noise replaced by its spectral projections, we obtain covariance operator
dependent sufficient and necessary conditions for the well-posedness of the
continuous problem. These SPDEs with projected noises are then used to
construct finite element approximations. We establish a general framework of
rigorous error estimates for finite element approximations. Based on this
framework and with the help of Weyl's law, we derive optimal error estimates
for finite element approximations of elliptic SPDEs driven by power-law noises
including white noises. In particular, we obtain 1.5 order convergence for one
dimensional white noise driven SPDE which improves the existing 1 order
results, and remove a usual infinitesimal factor for higher dimensional
problems.
