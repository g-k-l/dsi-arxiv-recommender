 <dc:description>  The static and dynamic properties of ring polymers in concentrated solutions
remains one of the last deep unsolved questions in Polymer Physics. At the same
time, the nature of the glass transition in polymeric systems is also not well
understood. In this work we study a novel glass transition in systems made of
circular polymers by exploiting the topological constraints that are
conjectured to populate concentrated solutions of rings. We show that such
rings strongly inter-penetrate through one another, generating an extensive
network of topological interactions that dramatically affects their dynamics.
We show that a kinetically arrested state can be induced by randomly pinning a
small fraction of the rings. This occurs well above the classical glass
transition temperature at which microscopic mobility is lost. Our work
demonstrates both the existence of long-lived inter-ring penetrations and also
realises a novel, topologically-induced, glass transition.
