 <dc:description>  A consequence of the results of Bers and Griffiths on the uniformization of
complex algebraic varieties is that the universal cover of a family of Riemann
surfaces, with base and fibers of finite hyperbolic type, is a contractible
2-dimensional domain that can be realized as the graph of a holomorphic motion
of the unit disk.
  In this paper we determine which holomorphic motions give rise to these
uniformizing domains and characterize which among them correspond to arithmetic
families (i.e. families defined over number fields). Then we apply these
results to characterize the arithmeticity of complex surfaces of general type
in terms of the biholomorphism class of the 2-dimensional domains that arise as
universal covers of their Zariski open subsets. For the important class of
Kodaira fibrations this criterion implies that arithmeticity can be read off
from the universal cover.
  All this is very much in contrast with the corresponding situation in complex
dimension one, where the universal cover is always the unit disk.
