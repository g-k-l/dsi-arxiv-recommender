 <dc:description>  In this paper, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for joint target position
and velocity estimation using an active or passive distributed radar network
under more general, and practically occurring, conditions than assumed in
previous work. In particular, the presented results allow nonorthogonal
signals, spatially dependent Gaussian reflection coefficients, and spatially
dependent Gaussian clutter-plus-noise. These bounds allow designers to compare
the performance of their developed approaches, which are deemed to be of
acceptable complexity, to the best achievable performance. If their developed
approaches lead to performance close to the bounds, these developed approaches
can be deemed "good enough". A particular recent study where algorithms have
been developed for a practical radar application which must involve
nonorthogonal signals, for which the best performance is unknown, is a great
example. The presented results in our paper do not make any assumptions about
the approximate location of the target being known from previous target
detection signal processing. In addition, for situations in which we do not
know some parameters accurately, we also derive the mismatched CRB. Numerical
investigations of the mean squared error of the maximum likelihood estimation
are employed to support the validity of the CRBs. In order to demonstrate the
utility of the provided results to a topic of great current interest, the
numerical results focus on a passive radar system using the Global System for
Mobile communication (GSM) cellar system.
