 <dc:description>  Recent experimental results have emphasized two aspects of Tb2Ti2O7 which
have not been taken into account in previous attempts to construct theories of
Tb2Ti2O7: the role of small levels of structural disorder, which appears to
control the formation of a long-range ordered state of as yet unknown nature;
and the importance of strong coupling between spin and lattice degrees of
freedom, which results in the hybridization of crystal field excitons and
transverse acoustic phonons. In this work we examine the juncture of these two
phenomena and show that samples with strongly contrasting behavior vis-a-vis
the structural disorder (i.e. with and without the transition to the ordered
state), develop identical magnetoelastic coupling. We also show that the
comparison between single crystal and powder samples is more complicated than
previously thought - the correlation between lattice parameter (as a measure of
superstoichiometric Tb$^{3+}$) and the existence of a specific heat peak, as
observed in powder samples, does not hold for single crystals.
