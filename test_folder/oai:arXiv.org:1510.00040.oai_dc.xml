 <dc:description>  In recent years, several new approaches for solving the large-scale
continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation have appeared in the literature.
Amodei and Buchot suggest computing a low-dimensional invariant subspace of the
associated Hamiltonian matrix. Simoncini and Lin also target the Hamiltonian
matrix, but in a different way: they iterate on the Cayley-transformed matrix
with various shifts. Wong and Balakrishnan directly generalize the Lyapunov
ADI-method to the Riccati equation. In this paper we introduce another method,
inspired by the Cholesky-factored variant of the Lyapunov ADI-method. The
advantage of the new algorithm is in its immediate and efficient low-rank
formulation, and a simpler implementation compared to the three algorithms
mentioned above. We discuss the theoretical properties of the new method, as
well as various shift selection strategies. Finally, we show that all of the
seemingly different methods listed above in fact produce exactly the same
iterates when used with the same parameters: they are algorithmically different
descriptions of the same approximation sequence to the Riccati solution.
