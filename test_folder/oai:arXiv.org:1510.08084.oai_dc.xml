 <dc:description>  The Magellanic Clouds provide the only laboratory to study the effect of
metallicity and galaxy mass on molecular gas and star formation at high (~20
pc) resolution. We use the dust emission from HERITAGE Herschel data to map the
molecular gas in the Magellanic Clouds, avoiding the known biases of CO
emission as a tracer of H$_{2}$. Using our dust-based molecular gas estimates,
we find molecular gas depletion times of ~0.4 Gyr in the LMC and ~0.6 SMC at 1
kpc scales. These depletion times fall within the range found for normal disk
galaxies, but are shorter than the average value, which could be due to recent
bursts in star formation. We find no evidence for a strong intrinsic dependence
of the molecular gas depletion time on metallicity. We study the relationship
between gas and star formation rate across a range in size scales from 20 pc to
~1 kpc, including how the scatter in molecular gas depletion time changes with
size scale, and discuss the physical mechanisms driving the relationships. We
compare the metallicity-dependent star formation models of Ostriker, McKee, and
Leroy (2010) and Krumholz (2013) to our observations and find that they both
predict the trend in the data, suggesting that the inclusion of a diffuse
neutral medium is important at lower metallicity.
