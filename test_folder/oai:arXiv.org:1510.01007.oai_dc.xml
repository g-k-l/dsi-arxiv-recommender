 <dc:description>  The mathematics of gauge theories lies behind many of the most profound
advances in physics in the last 200 years, from Maxwell's theory of
electromagnetism to Einstein's theory of general relativity. More recently it
has become clear that gauge theories also emerge in condensed matter, a prime
example being the spin ice materials which host an emergent electromagnetic
gauge field. In spin ice, the underlying gauge structure is revealed by the
presence of pinch-point singularities in neutron-scattering measurements. Here
we report the discovery of a spin liquid where the low-temperature physics is
naturally described by the fluctuations of a tensor field with a continuous
gauge freedom. This gauge structure underpins an unusual form of spin
correlations, giving rise to pinch-line singularities--- line-like analogues of
the pinch-points observed in spin ice. Remarkably, these features may already
have been observed in the pyrochlore material Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.
