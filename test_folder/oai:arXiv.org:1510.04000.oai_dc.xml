 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider pushdown graphs, i.e. infinite graphs that can be
described as transition graphs of deterministic real-time pushdown automata. We
consider the case where some vertices are designated as being final and we
built, in a breadth-first manner, a marking of edges that lead to such vertices
(i.e., for every vertex that can reach a final one, we mark all out-going edges
laying on some shortest path to a final vertex).
  Our main result is that the edge-marked version of a pushdown graph may
itself no longer be a pushdown graph, as we prove that this enrich graph may
have an undecidable MSO theory.
