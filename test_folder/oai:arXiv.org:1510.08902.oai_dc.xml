 <dc:description>  The advent of the new generation of X-ray telescopes yielded a significant
step forward in our understanding of ionised absorption generated in the
accretion discs of X-ray binaries. It has become evident that these relatively
weak and narrow absorption features, sporadically present in the X-ray spectra
of some systems, are actually the signature of equatorial outflows, which might
carry away more matter than that being accreted. Therefore, they play a major
role in the accretion phenomenon. These outflows (or ionised atmospheres) are
ubiquitous during the softer states but absent during the power-law dominated,
hard states, suggesting a strong link with the state of the inner accretion
disc, presence of the radio-jet and the properties of the central source. Here,
we discuss the current understanding of this field.
