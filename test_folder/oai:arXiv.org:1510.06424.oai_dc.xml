 <dc:description>  We incorporate Milky Way dark matter halo profile uncertainties, as well as
an accounting of diffuse gamma-ray emission uncertainties in dark matter
annihilation models for the Galactic Center Extended gamma-ray excess (GCE)
detected by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope. The range of particle
annihilation rate and masses expand when including these unknowns. However, two
of the most precise empirical determinations of the Milky Way halo's local
density and density profile leave the signal region to be in considerable
tension with dark matter annihilation searches from combined dwarf galaxy
analyses for single-channel dark matter annihilation models. The GCE and dwarf
tension can be alleviated if: one, the halo is very highly concentrated or
strongly contracted; two, the dark matter annihilation signal differentiates
between dwarfs and the GC; or, three, local stellar density measures are found
to be significantly lower, like that from recent stellar counts, increasing the
local dark matter density.
