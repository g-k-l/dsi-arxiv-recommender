 <dc:description>  Recent breakthroughs in Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP) have
demonstrated that the use of robust optimization, as opposed to stochastic
programming methods, renders the expansion planning problem computationally
tractable for real systems. State-of-the-art robust methods treat this problem
as stationary throughout the study period, with all the required investments on
expansion of lines being made at the beginning of the project horizon. However,
it is common knowledge that socioeconomic and environmental constraints might
change considerably during the network life, such as planned increases in
wind-power generation capacities, variations of environmental conditions due to
climate change, or changing trends in consumption patterns, and these changes
might also affect optimal capacity expansion planning. In this paper the
classical stationarity assumption is dispensed with and the existing adaptive
robust transmission expansion planning formulation for non-stationary
approaches is expanded. The solution for this problem provides information not
only about what additional lines must be installed but the construction timing
during the study horizon as well. Moreover, the more evenly spread scheduling
of construction, which, with the method put forward in this paper, is
distributed throughout the life of the network, enables corrective measures to
be taken in case the variables involved change in a manner different from that
initially conceived. Numerical results from an illustrative example and the
IEEE 118-bus system are presented and discussed, demonstrating the benefits of
this non-stationary approach with respect to classical methods.
