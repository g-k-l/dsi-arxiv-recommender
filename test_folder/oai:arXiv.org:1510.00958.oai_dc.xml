 <dc:description>  The rooted tree is an important data structure, and the subtree size, height,
and depth are naturally defined attributes of every node. We consider the
problem of the existence of a k-ary tree given a list of attribute sequences.
We give polynomial time (O(nlog(n))) algorithms for the existence of a k-ary
tree given depth and/or height sequences. Our most significant results are the
Strong NP-Completeness of the decision problems of existence of k-ary trees
given subtree sizes sequences. We prove this by multi-stage reductions from
NUMERICAL MATCHING WITH TARGET SUMS. In the process, we also prove a
generalized version of the 3-PARTITION problem to be Strongly NP-Complete. By
looking at problems where a combination of attribute sequences are given, we
are able to draw the boundary between easy and hard problems related to
existence of trees given attribute sequences and enhance our understanding of
where the difficulty lies in such problems.
