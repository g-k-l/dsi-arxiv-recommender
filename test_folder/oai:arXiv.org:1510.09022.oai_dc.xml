 <dc:description>  Opening up a band gap of the graphene and finding a suitable substrate are
two challenges for constituting the nano-electronic equipment. A new
two-dimensional layered crystal g-C2N (Nat. Commun. 2015, 6, 1--7) with novel
electronic and optical properties can be effectively synthesized via a
wet-chemical reaction. And g-C2N can be used as a suitable substrate to open
the band gap of graphene as much as 0.239 eV, which is large enough for the
band gap opening at room temperature. The physics behind the band gap opening
is that g-C2N substrate can produce the inhomogeneous electrostatic potential
over the graphene layer. The imposition of external electrical field can tune
the band gap of the hybrid of graphene/g-C2N effectively from the
semiconductors to the metal. The hybrid graphene/g-C2N displays an enhanced
optical activity compared with the pure g-C2N monolayer.
