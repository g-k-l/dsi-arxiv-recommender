 <dc:description>  We apply the covariant analytic mechanics with the differential forms to the
Dirac field and the gravity with the Dirac field. The covariant analytic
mechanics treats space and time on an equal footing regarding the differential
forms as the basic variables. A significant feature of the covariant analytic
mechanics is that the canonical equations, in addition to the Euler-Lagrange
equation, are not only manifestly general coordinate covariant but also gauge
covariant. Combining our study and the previous works (the scalar field, the
abelian and non-abelian gauge fields and the gravity without the Dirac field),
the applicability of the covariant analytic mechanics is checked for all
fundamental fields. We study both the first and second order formalism of the
gravitational field coupled with matters including the Dirac field. It is
suggested that gravitation theories including higher order curvatures cannot be
treated by the second order formalism in the covariant analytic mechanics.
