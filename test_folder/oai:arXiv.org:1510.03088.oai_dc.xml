 <dc:description>  We show that spectral problems for periodic operators on lattices with
embedded defects of lower dimensions can be solved with the help of
matrix-valued integral continued fractions. While these continued fractions are
usual in the approximation theory, they are less known in the context of
spectral problems. We show that the spectral points can be expressed as zeroes
of determinants of the continued fractions. They are also useful in the study
of inverse problems (one-to-one correspondence between spectral data and
defects). Finally, the explicit formula for the resolvent in terms of the
continued fractions is also provided. We apply some of our results to the
Schr\"odinger operator acting on the graphene with line and point defects.
