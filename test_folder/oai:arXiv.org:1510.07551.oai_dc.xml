 <dc:description>  We discuss how the ghost-free bigravity coupled with a single scalar field
can be derived from a braneworld setup. We consider DGP two-brane model without
radion stabilization. The bulk configuration is solved for given boundary
metrics, and it is substituted back into the action to obtain the effective
four-dimensional action. In order to obtain the ghost-free bigravity, we
consider the gradient expansion in which the brane separation is supposed to be
sufficiently small so that two boundary metrics are almost identical. The
obtained effective theory is shown to be ghost free as expected, however, the
interaction between two gravitons takes the Fierz-Pauli form at the leading
order of the gradient expansion, even though we do not use the approximation of
linear perturbation. We also find that the radion remains as a scalar field in
the four-dimensional effective theory, but its coupling to the metrics is
non-trivial.
