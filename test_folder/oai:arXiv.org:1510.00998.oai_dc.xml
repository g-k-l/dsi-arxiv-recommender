 <dc:description>  We present an effective criterion to determine if a normal analytic
compactification of C^2 with one irreducible curve at infinity is algebraic or
not. As a by product we establish a correspondence between normal algebraic
compactifications of C^2 with one irreducible curve at infinity and algebraic
curves contained in C^2 with one place at infinity. Using our criterion we
construct pairs of homeomorphic normal analytic surfaces with minimally
elliptic singularities such that one of the surfaces is algebraic and the other
is not. Our main technical tool is the sequence of "key forms" - a 'global'
variant of the sequence of "key polynomials" introduced by MacLane to study
valuations in the 'local' setting - which also extends the notion of
"approximate roots" of polynomials considered by Abhyankar and Moh.
