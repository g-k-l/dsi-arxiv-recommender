 <dc:description>  Recently, the Yang-Mills gradient flow is found to be a useful concept not
only in lattice simulations but also in continuous field theories. Since its
smearing property is similar to the Wilsoninan "block spin transformation",
there might be deeper connection between them. In this work, we define the
"effective action" which generates configurations at a finite flow time and
derive the exact differential equation to investigate the flow time dependence
of the action. Then Yang-Mills gradient flow can be regarded as the flow of the
effective action. We also propose the flow time dependent gradient, where the
differential equation becomes similar to the renormalization group equation. We
discuss a possibility to regard the time evolution of the effective action as
the Wilsonian renormalization group flow.
