 <dc:description>  We propose a new scenario to apply IR-pump-XUV-probe schemes to resolving
strong field ionization induced and attosecond pulse driven electron-hole
dynamics and coherence in real time. The coherent driving of both the infrared
laser and the attoscond pulse correlates the dynamics of the core-hole and the
valence-hole which leads to the otherwise forbidden absorption and emission of
XUV photon. An analytical model is developed based on the strong-field
approximation by taking into account of the essential multielectron
configurations. The emission spectra from the core-valence transition and the
core-hole recombination are found modulating strongly as functions of the time
delay between the two pulses, which provides a unique insight into the
instantaneous ionization and the interplay of the multi-electron-hole
coherence.
