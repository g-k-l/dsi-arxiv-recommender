 <dc:description>  The paper studies a distributed constrained optimization problem, where
multiple agents connected in a network collectively minimize the sum of
individual objective functions subject to a global constraint being an
intersection of the local constraint sets assigned to the agents. Based on the
augmented Lagrange method, a distributed primal-dual algorithm with a
projection operation included is proposed to solve the problem. It is shown
that with appropriately chosen constant step size, the local estimates derived
at all agents asymptotically reach a consensus at an optimal solution. In
addition, the value of the cost function at the time-averaged estimate
converges with rate $O(\frac{1}{k})$ to the optimal value for the unconstrained
problem. By these properties the proposed primal-dual algorithm is
distinguished from the existing algorithms for distributed constrained
optimization. The theoretical analysis is justified by numerical simulations.
