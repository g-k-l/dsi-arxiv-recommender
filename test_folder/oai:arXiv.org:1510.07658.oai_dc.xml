 <dc:description>  We present a new class of models of lepton flavor in the composite Higgs
framework. Following the concept of minimality, they lead to a rich
phenomenology in good agreement with the current experimental picture. Because
of a unification of the right-handed leptons, our scenario is very predictive
and can naturally lead to a violation of lepton-flavor universality in neutral
current interactions. We will show that, in particular, the anomaly in $R_K=
{\cal B}(B \to K \mu^+ \mu^-)/{\cal B}(B \to K e^+ e^-)$, found by LHCb, can be
addressed, while other constraints from quark- and lepton-flavor physics are
met. In fact, the minimal structure of the setup allows for the implementation
of a very powerful flavor protection, which avoids the appearance of new
sources of flavor-changing neutral currents to very good approximation.
Finally, the new lepton sector provides a parametrically enhanced correction to
the Higgs mass, such that the need for ultra-light top partners is weakened
considerably, linking the mass of the latter with the size of the neutrino
masses.
