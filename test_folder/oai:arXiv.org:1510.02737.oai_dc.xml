 <dc:description>  Sensing in the presence of environmental noise is a problem of increasing
practical interest. In a master equation description, where the state of the
environment is unobserved, the effect of signal and noise is described by
system operators only. In this context it is well-known that noise that is
orthogonal on an external signal can be corrected for without perturbing the
signal, while similarly efficient strategies for non-orthogonal signal and
noise operators are not known. Here we make use of the fact that
system-environment interaction typically arises via local two-body interactions
describing the exchange of quanta between system and environment, which are
observable in principle. That two-body-interactions are usually orthogonal on
system operators, allows us to develop error corrected sensing supported by the
observation of the quanta that are emitted into the environment. We describe
such schemes and outline a realistic proof-of-principle experiment in an ion
trap set-up.
