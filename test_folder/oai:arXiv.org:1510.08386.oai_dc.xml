 <dc:description>  We provide applications to studying the behavior of Selmer groups under
specialization. We consider Selmer groups associated to 4-dimensional Galois
representations coming from (i) the tensor product of two cuspidal Hida
families F and G, (ii) its cyclotomic deformation, (iii) the tensor product of
a cusp form f and the Hida family G, where f is a classical specialization of F
with weight k &gt;= 2. We prove control theorems to relate (a) the Selmer group
associated to the tensor product of Hida families F and G to the Selmer group
associated to its cyclotomic deformation and (b) the Selmer group associated to
the tensor product of f and G to the Selmer group associated to the tensor
product of F and G. On the analytic side of the main conjectures, Hida has
constructed 1-variable, 2-variable and 3-variable Rankin-Selberg p-adic
L-functions. Our specialization results enable us to verify that Hida's results
relating (a) the 2-variable p-adic L-function to the 3-variable p-adic
L-function and (b) the 1-variable p-adic L-function to the 2-variable p-adic
L-function and our control theorems for Selmer groups are completely consistent
with the main conjectures.
