 <dc:description>  We prove a randomized version of the generalized Urysohn inequality relating
mean-width to the other intrinsic volumes. To do this, we introduce a
stochastic approximation procedure that sees each convex body K as the limit of
intersections of Euclidean balls of large radii and centered at randomly chosen
points. The proof depends on a new isoperimetric inequality for the intrinsic
volumes of such intersections. If the centers are i.i.d. and sampled according
to a bounded continuous distribution, then the extremizing measure is uniform
on a Euclidean ball. If one additionally assumes that the centers have i.i.d.
coordinates, then the uniform measure on a cube is the extremizer. We also
discuss connections to a randomized version of the extended isoperimetric
inequality and symmetrization techniques.

 <dc:description>Comment: Sections 4 and 5 have been rewritten, along with the relevant
  motivation for these in the introduction. We now compare our results with
  kindred work on intersections of random halfspaces. We also discuss further
  consequences of the stochastic dominance in Theorem 1.1</dc:description>
