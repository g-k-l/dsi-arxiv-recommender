 <dc:description>  Plasmonic metasurfaces are able to modify the wavefront by altering the light
intensity, phase and polarization state. Active plasmonic metasurfaces would
allow dynamic modulation of the wavefront which give rise to interesting
application such as beam-steering, holograms and tunable waveplates. Graphene
is an interesting material with dynamic property which can be controlled by
electrical gating at an ultra-fast speed. We use a graphene-integrated
metasurface to induce a tunable phase change to the wavefront. The metasurface
supports a Fano resonance which produces high-quality resonances around 7.7
microns. The phase change is measured using a Michleson interferometry setup.
It is shown that the reflection phase can change up to 55 degrees. In
particular the phase can change by 28 degrees while the amplitude is nearly
constant. The anisotropic optical response of the metasurface is used to
modulate the ellipticity of the reflected wave in response to an incident field
at 45 degree. We show a proof of concept application of our system in
potentially ultra-fast laser interferometry with sub-micron accuracy.
