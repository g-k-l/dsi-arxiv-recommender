 <dc:description>  Quantile regression, that is the prediction of a random variable's quantiles
conditioned on other random variables taking on certain values, has steadily
gained importance in statistical modeling and financial applications. We
introduce a new semiparametric quantile regression method based on sequentially
fitting a likelihood optimal D-vine copula to given data resulting in highly
flexible models with easily extractable conditional quantiles. As a subclass of
regular vine copulas, D-vines enable the modeling of multivariate copulas in
terms of bivariate building blocks, a so-called pair-copula construction (PCC).
The proposed algorithm works fast and accurate even in high dimensions and
incorporates an automatic variable selection by maximizing the conditional
log-likelihood. Further, typical issues of quantile regression such as quantile
crossing or transformations, interactions and collinearity of variables are
automatically taken care of. In a simulation study the improved accuracy and
saved computational time of the approach in comparison with established
quantile regression methods is highlighted. An extensive financial application
to international credit default swap (CDS) data including stress testing and
Value-at-Risk (VaR) prediction demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed
method.
