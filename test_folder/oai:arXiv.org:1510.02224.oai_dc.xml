 <dc:description>  Quaternion-valued differential equations (QDEs) is a new kind of differential
equations which have many applications in physics and life sciences. The
largest difference between QDEs and ODEs is the algebraic structure. On the
non-commutativity of the quaternion algebra, the algebraic structure of the
solutions to the QDEs is completely different from ODEs. It is actually a left-
or right- free module, not a linear vector space.
  This paper establishes a systematic frame work for the theory of linear QDEs,
which can be applied to quantum mechanics, fluid mechanics, Frenet frame in
differential geometry, kinematic modelling, attitude dynamics, Kalman filter
design and spatial rigid body dynamics, etc. We prove that the algebraic
structure of the solutions to the QDEs is actually a left- or right- module,
not a linear vector space. On the non-commutativity of the quaternion algebra,
many concepts and properties for the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can
not be used. They should be redefined accordingly. A definition of Wronskian is
introduced under the framework of quaternions which is different from standard
one in the ordinary differential equations. Liouville formula for QDEs is
given. Also, it is necessary to treat the eigenvalue problems with left- and
right-sides, accordingly. Upon these, we studied the solutions to the linear
QDEs. Furthermore, we present two algorithms to evaluate the fundamental
matrix. Some concrete examples are given to show the feasibility of the
obtained algorithms. Finally, a conclusion and discussion ends the paper.
