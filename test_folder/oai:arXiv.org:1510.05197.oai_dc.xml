 <dc:description>  Electrons in graphene can travel for several microns without scattering at
low temperatures, and their motion becomes ballistic, following classical
trajectories. When a magnetic field B is applied perpendicular to the plane,
electrons follow cyclotron orbits. Magnetic focusing occurs when electrons
injected from one narrow contact focus onto a second contact located an integer
number of cyclotron diameters away. By tuning the magnetic field B and electron
density n in the graphene layer, we observe magnetic focusing peaks. We use a
cooled scanning gate microscope to image cyclotron trajectories in graphene at
4.2 K. The tip creates a local change in density that casts a shadow by
deflecting electrons flowing nearby; an image of flow can be obtained by
measuring the transmission between contacts as the tip is raster scanned across
the sample. On the first magnetic focusing peak, we image a cyclotron orbit
that extends from one point contact to the other. In addition, we study the
geometry of orbits deflected into the second point contact by the tip.
