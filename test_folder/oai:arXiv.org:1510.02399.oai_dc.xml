 <dc:description>  The paper studies Non-Stationary Dynamic Factor Models such that: (1)~the
factors $\mathbf F_t$ are $I(1)$ and singular, i.e. $\mathbf F_t$ has dimension
$r$ and is driven by a $q$-dimensional white noise, the common shocks, with
$q&lt;r$, and (2)~the idiosyncratic components are $I(1)$. We show that $\mathbf
F_t$ is driven by $r-c$ permanent shocks, where $c$ is the cointegration rank
of $\mathbf F_t$, and $q-(r-c)&lt;c$ transitory shocks, thus the same result as in
the non-singular case for the permanent shocks but not for the transitory
shocks. Our main result is obtained by combining the classic Granger
Representation Theorem with recent results by Anderson and Deistler on singular
stochastic vectors: if $(1-L)\mathbf F_t$ is singular and has rational spectral
density then, for generic values of the parameters, $\mathbf F_t$ has an
autoregressive representation with a finite-degree matrix polynomial fulfilling
the restrictions of a Vector Error Correction Mechanism with $c$ error terms.
This result is the basis for consistent estimation of Non-Stationary Dynamic
Factor Models. The relationship between cointegration of the factors and
cointegration of the observable variables is also discussed.
