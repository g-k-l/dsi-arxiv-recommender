 <dc:description>  We show that equilibria derived for nonatomic games (NGs) can be used by
large finite games to achieve near-equilibrium performances. Rather than
single-period games, we deal with dynamic games in which the evolution of a
player's state is influenced by his own action as well as other players' states
and actions. We focus on the case where both random state transitions and
random actions are driven by independently generated shocks. The NG equilibria
we consider are random state-to-action maps. The simple NG equilibria are
adoptable to a variety of real situations where awareness of other players'
states can be anywhere between full and none. Transient results here also form
the basis for a link between an NG's stationary equilibrium (SE) and good
stationary profiles for large finite games. Our approach works well for certain
dynamic pricing games, both without and with production.
