 <dc:description>  With the back-reaction of Hawking radiation taken into consideration, the
work of Kawai, Matsuo and Yokokura has shown that, under a few assumptions, the
collapse of matter does not lead to event horizon nor apparent horizon. In this
paper, we relax their assumptions and elaborate on the space-time geometry of a
generic collapsing body with spherical symmetry. The geometry outside the
collapsing sphere is found to be approximated by the geometry outside the
white-hole horizon, hence the collapsing matter remains outside the
Schwarzschild radius. As particles in Hawking radiation are created in the
vicinity of the collapsing matter, the information loss paradox is alleviated.
Assuming that the collapsing body evaporates within finite time, there is no
event horizon.
