 <dc:description>  The static dielectric constant of liquid water is computed using classical
force field based molecular dynamics simulation at fixed electric displacement
D. The method to constrain the electric displacement is the finite temperature
classical variant of the constant-D method developed by Stengel, Spaldin and
Vanderbilt (Nat. Phys. 2009, 5: 304). There is also a modification of this
scheme imposing fixed values of the macroscopic field E. The method is applied
to the popular SPC/E model of liquid water. We compare four different estimates
of the dielectric constant, two obtained from fluctuations of the polarization
at D = 0 and E = 0 and two from the variation of polarization with finite D and
E. It is found that all four estimates agree when properly converged. The
computational effort to achieve convergence varies however, with constant D
calculations being substantially more efficient. We attribute this difference
to the much shorter relaxation time of longitudinal polarization compared to
transverse polarization accelerating constant D calculations.
