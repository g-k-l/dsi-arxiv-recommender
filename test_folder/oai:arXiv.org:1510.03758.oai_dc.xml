 <dc:description>  We study the positivity and regularity of solutions to the fractional porous
medium equations $u_t+(-\Delta)^su^m=0$ in $(0,\infty)\times\Omega$, for $m&gt;1$
and $s\in (0,1)$ and with Dirichlet boundary data $u=0$ in
$(0,\infty)\times({\mathbb R}^N\setminus\Omega)$, and nonnegative initial
condition $u(0,\cdot)=u_0\geq0$.
  Our first result is a quantitative lower bound for solutions which holds for
all positive times $t&gt;0$. As a consequence, we find a global Harnack principle
stating that for any $t&gt;0$ solutions are comparable to $d^{s/m}$, where $d$ is
the distance to $\partial\Omega$. This is in sharp contrast with the local case
$s=1$, in which the equation has finite speed of propagation.
  After this, we study the regularity of solutions. We prove that solutions are
classical in the interior ($C^\infty$ in $x$ and $C^{1,\alpha}$ in $t$) and
establish a sharp $C^{s/m}_x$ regularity estimate up to the boundary.
  Our methods are quite general, and can be applied to a wider class of
nonlocal parabolic equations of the form $u_t-\mathcal L F(u)=0$ in $\Omega$,
both in bounded or unbounded domains.
