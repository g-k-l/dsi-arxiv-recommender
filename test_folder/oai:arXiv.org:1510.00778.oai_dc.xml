 <dc:description>  The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) is designed for high
energy gamma ray and cosmic ray detection. A Water Cherenkov Detector Array
which is sensitive to gamma ray showers above a few hundred GeV is proposed to
survey gamma ray sources. The WCDA consists of 3600 PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMT)
which collect the Cherenkov light produced by the shower particles in water.
Both high precision time and charge measurement are required over a large
dynamic range from 1 photo electron (P.E.) to 4000 P.E. Prototype of an
analogue front-end Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) fabricated in
Chartered 0.35 {\mu}m CMOS technology is designed to read out PMT signal in the
WCDA. This ASIC employs leading edge discrimination and RC4 shaping structure;
combined with the following Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) and
Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), both the arrival time and charge of the PMT
signal can be measured. Initial test results indicate that time resolution is
better than 350 ps and charge resolution is better than 10% at 1 P.E. and
better than 1% with large input signals (300 P.E. to 4000 P.E.). Besides, this
ASIC has a small channel-to-channel crosstalk and low ambient temperature
dependency.
