 <dc:description>  We consider a new reaction-transport framework, and apply it to the problem
of advection-driven biotic transport. There are two compartments - a growth
layer, coupled to a separate advective layer. Density fronts propagate in both
layers. Crucially, the downwind front speed goes to a finite value as the
coupling goes to zero. We next include diffusion in the growth layer, and study
the competition between the advective and diffusive transport mechanisms.
Advection dominates for small diffusion and cannot be ignored, no matter how
weak the coupling is. When the coupling is not small, both mechanisms work
cooperatively, without a clear winner. Moreover, there is a special diffusion
constant at which the front speed is independent of the coupling.
