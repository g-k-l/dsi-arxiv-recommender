 <dc:description>  The functional and computational power of a network emerges as a prop- erty
of the system operating as a coherent whole at a global scale, not at the scale
of individual nodes. A natural question to ask is what are the physical
principles that allow a collection of nodes to interact in such away that they
produce emergent global network dynamics? Here, we address this question by
developing a generalized theoretical framework that formally describes how in
any physically constructible geometric network, the geome- try of the network
i.e. its physical structure, constrains and bounds signaling and the flow of
information through the network. This then in turn predicts the emergent
dynamics of the network. Our results illustrate how the in- terplay between
strictly local geometric and temporal process at the scale of individual node
pairs directly affects the behavior of the whole network. We also provide
empirical evidence that at least some important examples of widely different
naturally occurring and engineered networks follow these theoretical
principles.
