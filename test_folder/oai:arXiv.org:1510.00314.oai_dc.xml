 <dc:description>  We investigate the local structure factor $S(z;q)$ at a free liquid-gas
interface in systems with short-ranged intermolecular forces and determine the
corrections to the leading-order, capillary-wave-like, Goldstone mode
divergence of $S(z;q)$ known to occur for parallel wavevectors $q\to 0$. We
show from explicit solution of the inhomogeneous Ornstein-Zernike equation that
for distances $z$ far from the interface, where the profile decays
exponentially, $S(z;q)$ splits unambiguously into bulk and interfacial
contributions. On each side of the interface, the interfacial contributions can
be characterised by distinct liquid and gas wavevector dependent surface
tensions, $\sigma_l(q)$ and $\sigma_g(q)$, which are determined solely by the
$bulk$ two-body and three-body direct correlation functions. At high
temperatures, the wavevector dependence simplifies and is determined almost
entirely by the appropriate bulk structure factor, leading to positive rigidity
coefficients. Our predictions are confirmed by explicit calculation of $S(z;q)$
within square-gradient theory and the Sullivan model. The results for the
latter predict a striking temperature dependence for $\sigma_l(q)$ and
$\sigma_g(q)$, and have implications for fluctuation effects. Our results
account quantitatively for the findings of a recent very extensive simulation
study by H\"ofling and Dietrich of the total structure factor in the
interfacial region, in a system with a cut-off Lennard-Jones potential, in
sharp contrast to extended Capillary-Wave models which failed completely to
describe the simulation results.
