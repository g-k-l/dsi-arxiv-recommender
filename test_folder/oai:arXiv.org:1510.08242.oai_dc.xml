 <dc:description>  In the framework of the Glauber model as implemented in GLISSANDO 2, we study
the fluctuations of flow harmonics in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC
centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV. The model with wounded nucleons and the
admixture of binary collisions leads to reasonable agreement for the
ellipticity and triangularity fluctuations with the experimental data from the
ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations, verifying the assumption that the initial
eccentricity is approximately proportional to the harmonic flow of charged
particles. While the agreement, in particular at the level of event-by-event
distributions of eccentricities/flow coefficients in not perfect, it leads to a
fair (at the level of a few percent for all centralities except the most
peripheral collisions) description of the scaled standard deviation and the F
measure which involve the four-particle cumulants. We also discuss the case of
quadrangular flow. Computer scripts that generate our results from the
GLISSANDO 2 simulations are provided.
