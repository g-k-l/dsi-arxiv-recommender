 <dc:description>  This paper investigates distributed angular frequency regulation of
multi-machine power systems with wind generations when wind power signals'
frequencies are known (and unknown). The challenge is to regulate angular
frequencies under fast changing and unpredictable wind generations. To address
the issue, we split unknown signals into three parts according to their
frequency ranges and design an (adaptive) internal model to reconstruct the low
and medium frequency parts. We integrate heterogeneous grid components to deal
with fast changing signals. At each bus with wind power generations, a battery
energy storage system is used to filter out high frequency components of wind
generations. At generator bus, demand response is utilized to deal with their
medium frequency components and a synchronous generator is exploited to handle
their low frequency components. At load bus, demand response handles low and
medium frequency components. The proposed controllers ensure exponential
stability (and asymptotic convergence) of system states with respect to their
desired signals. Simulations on the IEEE 68-bus test system are conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.
