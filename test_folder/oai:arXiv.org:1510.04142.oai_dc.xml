 <dc:description>  The numerical condition of the problem of intersecting a fixed
$m$-dimensional irreducible complex projective variety $Z\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$
with a varying linear subspace $L\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ of complementary
dimension $s=n-m$ is studied. We define the intersection condition number
$\kappa_Z(L,z)$ at a smooth intersection point $z\in Z\cap L$ as the norm of
the derivative of the locally defined solution map
$\mathbb{G}(s,\mathbb{P}^n)\to\mathbb{P}^n,\, L\mapsto z$. We show that
$\kappa_Z(L,z) = 1/\sin\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the minimum angle between the
tangent spaces $T_zZ$ and $T_zL$. From this, we derive a condition number
theorem that expresses $1/\kappa_Z(L,z)$ as the distance of $L$ to the local
Schubert variety, which consists of the linear subspaces having an ill-posed
intersection with $Z$ at $z$. A probabilistic analysis of the maximum condition
number $\kappa_Z(L) := \max \kappa_Z(L,z_i)$, taken over all intersection
points $z_i\in Z\cap L$, leads to the study of the volume of tubes around the
Hurwitz hypersurface $\Sigma(Z)$. As a first step towards this, we express the
volume of $\Sigma(Z)$ in terms of its degree.

 <dc:description>Comment: A technically involved proof in the previous version was replaced by
  a short argument from complex algebraic geometry. This led to a substantial
  shortening of paper</dc:description>
