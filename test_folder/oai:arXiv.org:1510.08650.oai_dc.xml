 <dc:description>  Recent experiments access the time-resolved photoelectron signal originating
from plasmon satellites in correlated materials and address their build-up and
decay in real time. Motivated by these developments, we present the
Kadanoff-Baym formalism for the nonequilibrium time evolution of interacting
fermions and bosons. In contrast to the fermionic case the bosons are described
by second-order differential equations. Solution of the bosonic Kadanoff-Baym
equations - which is the central ingredient of this work - requires substantial
modification of the usual two-times electronic propagation scheme. The solution
is quite general and can be applied to a number of problems, such as the
interaction of electrons with quantized photons, phonons and other bosonic
excitations. Here, the formalism is applied to the photoemission from a deep
core hole accompanied by plasmon excitation. We compute the time-resolved
photoelectron spectra and discuss the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic
electron energy losses and their interference.
