 <dc:description>  While melting in two and three dimensions is substantially different, the
glass transition in various dimensions is usually described within the same
theoretical framework. Computer simulations recently observed fundamental
differences in glassy dynamics, depending on dimensionality: orientational and
structural relaxation do not appear simultaneously in two dimensions [1].
Comparing experiments from 2D crystals, 2D amorphous solids, and 3D amorphous
solids we confirm this separation of time scales in 2D glass. However, using
concepts of 2D crystallography we can entirely explain this without changing
the microscopic picture of the glass transition. Long wavelength density
fluctuations, so-called Mermin-Wagner fluctuations, affect translational
degrees of freedom but not orientational ones. Using local coordinates, the
difference in the time scales disappear in 2D glass. Furthermore we can
demonstrate with computer simulations the logarithmic increase of displacements
predicted by Mermin and Wagner: periodicity is not a requirement for
Mermin-Wagner fluctuations which conserve the homogeneity of space on long
scales.
