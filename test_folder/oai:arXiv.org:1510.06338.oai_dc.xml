 <dc:description>  We have recently highlighted the presence of a periodically oscillating 10 \%
modulation in the BABAR data on the proton timelike form factors, in the
reaction $e^++e^-$ $\rightarrow$ $\bar{p}+p$. Here we deepen our previous data
analysis, and confirm that in the case of several standard parametrizations it
is possible to write the form factor in the form $F_0$ $+$ $F_{osc}$, where
$F_0$ is a parametrization expressing the long-range trend of the form factor
(for $q^2$ ranging from the $\bar{p}p$ threshold to 36 GeV$^2$), and $F_{osc}$
is a function of the form $\exp(-Bp)\cos(Cp)$, where $p$ is the relative
momentum of the final $\bar{p}p$ pair. Error bars allow for a clean
identification of the main features of this modulation for $q^2$ $&lt;$ 10
GeV$^2$. Assuming this oscillatory modulation to be an effect of final state
interactions between the forming proton and the antiproton, we propose a
phenomenological model based on a double-layer imaginary optical potential.
This potential is flux-absorbing when the distance between the proton and
antiproton centers of mass is $\gtrsim$ 1.7-1.8 fm and flux-generating when it
is $\lesssim$ 1.7-1.8 fm. The main features of the oscillations may be
reproduced with some freedom in the potential parameters, but the transition
between the two layers must be sudden (0-0.2 fm) to get the correct oscillation
period. The flux-absorbing part of the $\bar{p}p$ interaction is due to the
annihilation of $\bar{p}p$ pairs into multi-meson states. We interpret the
flux-creating part of the potential as due to the creation of a $1/q$-ranged
state when the virtual photon decays into a set of current quarks and
antiquarks, including heavy ones, that may exist for a short time. The decay of
these large mass states leads to an intermediate stage regeneration of the
$\bar{p}p$ channel.
