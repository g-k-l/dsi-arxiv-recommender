 <dc:description>  We develop and generalize the theory of extreme value for non-stationary
stochastic processes, mostly by weakening the uniform mixing condition that was
previously used in this setting. We apply our results to non-autonomous
dynamical systems, in particular to sequential dynamical systems, both given by
uniformly expanding maps and by maps with a neutral fixed point, and to a few
classes of random dynamical systems. Some examples are presented and worked out
in detail.
