 <dc:description>  I review the chiral dynamics of nuclear physics. In the first part, I discuss
the new developments in the construction of the forces between two, three and
four nucleons which have been partly carried out to fifth order in the chiral
expansion. It is also shown that based on these forces in conjunction with the
estimation of the corresponding theoretical uncertainties, the need for
three-nucleon forces in few nucleon systems can be unambiguously established. I
also introduce the lattice formulation of these forces, which allow for truly
ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. I present some
pertinent results of the nuclear lattice approach. Finally, I discuss how
few-nucleon systems and nuclei can be used to explore symmetries and physics
within and beyond the Standard Model.
