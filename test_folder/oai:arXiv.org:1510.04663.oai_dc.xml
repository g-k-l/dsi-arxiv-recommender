 <dc:description>  We are interested in the analysis of Gibbs measures defined on two
independent Brownian paths in $\R^d$ interacting through a mutual
self-attraction. This is expressed by the Hamiltonian $\int\int_{\R^{2d}}
V(x-y) \mu(\d x)\nu(\d y)$ with two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$
representing the occupation measures of two independent Brownian motions. We
will be interested in class of potentials $V$ which is singular, e.g., Dirac or
Coulomb type interactions in $\R^3$, or the correlation function of the
spatially smoothened parabolic Anderson problem with white noise potential.
  The mutual interaction of the Brownian paths inspires a compactification of
the quotient space of orbits of product measures, which is structurally
different from the self-interacting case introduced in \cite{MV14}, owing to
the lack of shift-invariant structure in the mutual interaction. We prove
strong large deviation principle for the product measures of two Brownian
occupation measures in such a compactification, and derive asymptotic path
behavior under Gibbs measures on Wiener paths, arising from mutually attracting
singular interactions. For the spatially smoothened parabolic Anderson model
with white noise potential, our analysis allows a direct computation of the
annealed Lyapunov exponents and a strict ordering of them implies the
intermittency effect present in the smoothened model.
