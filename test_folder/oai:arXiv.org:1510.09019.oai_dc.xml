 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the enumeration of rooted and unrooted hypermaps of a
given genus. For rooted hypermaps the enumeration method consists of
considering the more general family of multirooted hypermaps, in which darts
other than the root dart are distinguished. We give functional equations for
the generating series counting multirooted hypermaps of a given genus by number
of darts, vertices, edges, faces and the degrees of the vertices containing the
distinguished darts. We solve these equations to get parametric expressions of
the generating functions of rooted hypermaps of low genus. We also count
unrooted hypermaps of given genus by number of darts, vertices, hyperedges and
faces.
