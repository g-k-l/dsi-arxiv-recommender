 <dc:description>  The perturbation method is proposed to obtain the effective delayed neutron
fraction (\b{eta}eff) of a cylindrical highly enriched uranium reactor. Based
on the reactivity measurements with and without a sample at a designable
position using the positive periodic technique, the reactor reactivity
perturbation {\Delta}\r{ho} of the sample in \b{eta}eff units is measured. The
simulation of the perturbation experiments are performed by MCNP program. The
PERT card is used to provide the difference dk of effective neutron
multiplication factors with and without the sample inside the reactor. Based on
the relationship between the effective multiplication factor and the
reactivity, the equation \b{eta}eff =dk/{\Delta}\r{ho} is derived. In this
paper, the reactivity perturbations of 13 metal samples at the designable
position of the reactor are measured and calculated. The average \b{eta}eff
value of the reactor is given as 0.00645, and the standard uncertainty is 3.0%.
Additionally, the perturbation experiments for \b{eta}eff can be used to
evaluate the reliabilities of the delayed neutron parameters. This work showed
that the delayed neutron data of 235U and 238U from G.R.Keepin's publication
are more reliable than those from ENDF-B6.0, ENDF-B7.0, JENDL3.3 and CENDL2.2.
