 <dc:description>  In this dissertation the question of the unification of quantum theory and
general relativity is treated. Based on the conceptual structure of these
theories and under incorporation of certain ideas from classical philosophy
there are formulated arguments for the assertion that these two fundamental
theories of nature can only be led to a unification in the framework of a
description, in which space-time is not presupposed but constituted by a more
fundamental physical reality. Under this precondition an own model to derive
the mathematical structure of general relativity from a unified quantum field
theory of spinors is developed. In addition the quantum theory of fundamental
binary logical alternatives, which has been conceived by Carl Friedrich von
Weizs\"acker in the second half of the twentieth century and in which the
existence of physical space and his properties is a consequence of quantum
theory, is treated elaborately and considered with respect to the question of
the unification of quantum theory and general relativity.
