 <dc:description>  Owing to the complexity and variability of metagenomic studies, modern
machine learning approaches have seen increased usage to answer a variety of
question encompassing the full range of metagenomic NGS data analysis. We
review here the contribution of machine learning techniques for the field of
metagenomics, by presenting known successful approaches in a unified framework.
This review focuses on five important metagenomic problems: OTU-clustering,
binning, taxonomic profling and assignment, comparative metagenomics and gene
prediction. For each of these problems, we identify the most prominent methods,
summarize the machine learning approaches used and put them into perspective of
similar methods. We conclude our review looking further ahead at the challenge
posed by the analysis of interactions within microbial communities and
different environments, in a field one could call "integrative metagenomics".
