 <dc:description>  We propose a game-theoretic framework that incorporates both incomplete
information and general ambiguity attitudes on factors external to all players.
Our starting point is players' preferences on payoff-distribution vectors,
essentially mappings from states of the world to be faced by players with
particular types to distributions of their payoffs. There are two ways to
define equilibria for this preference game. When the preferences possess ever
more features, we can gradually add ever more structures to the game. These
include real-valued utility-like functions over the aforementioned vectors,
prior sets over states of the world, and eventually the traditional
expected-utility framework. Under mild conditions, we establish equilibrium
existence results and uncover relations between the two versions of equilibria.
Particular attention is paid to what we shall call the enterprising game, in
which players bet optimistically on the favorable resolution of ambiguities.
The two solution concepts are unified at this game's pure equilibria, whose
existence is guaranteed when strategic complementarities are present. The
current framework can be applied to used-car sales involving retaliatory
buyers, auctions involving ambiguity on competitors' assessments of item
worths, and competitive pricing involving uncertain demand curves.
