 <dc:description>  We present an attention-based modular neural framework for computer vision.
The framework uses a soft attention mechanism allowing models to be trained
with gradient descent. It consists of three modules: a recurrent attention
module controlling where to look in an image or video frame, a
feature-extraction module providing a representation of what is seen, and an
objective module formalizing why the model learns its attentive behavior. The
attention module allows the model to focus computation on task-related
information in the input. We apply the framework to several object tracking
tasks and explore various design choices. We experiment with three data sets,
bouncing ball, moving digits and the real-world KTH data set. The proposed
Recurrent Attentive Tracking Model performs well on all three tasks and can
generalize to related but previously unseen sequences from a challenging
tracking data set.
