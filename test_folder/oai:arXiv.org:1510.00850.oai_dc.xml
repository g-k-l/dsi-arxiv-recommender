 <dc:description>  Inference of clusters over networks is a central problem in machine learning.
Commonly, it is formulated as a discrete optimization, and a continuous
relaxation is used to obtain a spectral algorithm. An alternative problem
formulation arises by considering a latent space model, in which edge
probabilities are determined by continuous latent positions. A model of
particular interest is the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), which can be fit
using an efficient spectral method; however, this method is based on a
heuristic that can fail, even in simple cases. In this paper, we consider a
closely related latent space model, the Logistic RDPG, which uses a logistic
link function to map from latent position inner products to edge likelihoods.
Over this model, we show that asymptotically exact maximum likelihood inference
of the latent position vectors can be achieved using a spectral method. Our
method involves computing the top eigenvectors of a normalized adjacency matrix
and scaling the eigenvectors using a regression step. Through simulations, we
show that this method is more accurate and more robust than existing spectral
and semidefinite network clustering methods. In particular, the novel
regression scaling step is essential to the performance gain of the proposed
method.
