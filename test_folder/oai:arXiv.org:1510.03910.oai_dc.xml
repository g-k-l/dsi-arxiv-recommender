 <dc:description>  Recent technological advances in integrated photonics have spurred on the
study of topological phenomena in engineered bosonic systems. Indeed, the
controllability of silicon ring-resonator arrays has opened up new perspectives
for building lattices for photons with topologically nontrivial bands and
integrating them into photonic devices for practical applications. Here, we
push these developments even further by exploiting the different modes of a
silicon ring resonator as an extra dimension for photons. Tunneling along this
synthetic dimension is implemented via an external time-dependent modulation
that allows for the generation of engineered gauge fields. We show how this
approach can be used to generate a variety of exciting topological phenomena in
integrated photonics, ranging from a topologically-robust optical isolator in a
spatially one-dimensional (1D) ring-resonator chain to a driven-dissipative
analog of the 4D quantum Hall effect in a spatially 3D resonator lattice. Our
proposal paves the way towards the use of topological effects in the design of
novel photonic lattices supporting many frequency channels and displaying
higher connectivities.
