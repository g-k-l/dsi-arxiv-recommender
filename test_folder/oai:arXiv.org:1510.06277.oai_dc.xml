 <dc:description>  Random access codes are important for a wide range of applications in quantum
information. However, their implementation with quantum theory can be made in
two very different ways: (i) by distributing data with strong spatial
correlations violating a Bell inequality, or (ii) using quantum communication
channels to create stronger-than-classical sequential correlations between
state preparation and measurement outcome. Here, we study this duality of the
quantum realization. We present a family of Bell inequalities tailored to the
task at hand and study their quantum violations. Remarkably, we show that the
use of spatial and sequential quantum correlations imposes different
limitations on the performance of quantum random access codes. We also show
that there exist random access codes for which spatial quantum correlations
offer no gain over classical strategies, whereas sequential quantum
correlations can yield an advantage. We discuss the physics behind the observed
discrepancy between spatial and sequential quantum correlations.
