 <dc:description>  We recapitulate the primary sources of theoretical uncertainties in proton
lifetime estimates in renormalizable, four-dimensional and non-supersymmetric
grand unifications that represent the most conservative framework in which this
question may be addressed at the perturbative level. We point out that many of
these uncertainties are so severe that there are only very few scenarios in
which an NLO approach, as crucial as it is for a real testability of any
specific model, is actually sensible. Among these, the most promising seems to
be the minimal renormalizable SO(10) GUT whose high-energy gauge symmetry is
spontaneously broken by the adjoint and the five-index antisymmetric
irreducible representations.
