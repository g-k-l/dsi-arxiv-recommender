 <dc:description>  The study of kiloparsec-scale dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) will provide
important clues to understand the co-evolution between the host galaxies and
their central supermassive black holes undergoing a merging process. We present
long-slit spectroscopy of the J0038$+$4128, a kiloparsec-scale dual AGN
candidate discovered by Huang et al. recently, using the Yunnan Faint Object
Spectrograph and Camera (YFOSC) mounted on Li-Jiang 2.4-m telescope at Yunnan
observatories. From the long-slit spectra, we find that the average relative
line-of-sight (LOS) velocity between the two nuclei (J0038$+$4128N and
J0038$+$4128S) is about 150 km s$^{-1}$. The LOS velocities of the emission
lines from the gas ionized by the nuclei activities and of the absorption lines
from stars governed by the host galaxies for different regions of the
J0038$+$4128 exhibit the same trend. The same velocities trend indicates that
the gaseous disks are co-rotating with the stellar disks in this ongoing merge
system. We also find several knots/giant HII regions scattered around the two
nuclei with strong star formation revealed by the observed line ratios from the
spectra. Those regions are also detected clearly in HST $F336W/U$-band and HST
$F555W/V$-band images.
