 <dc:description>  The structural, electronic and optical properties of nearly ferromagnetic
compound HfZn2 have been studied using ab-initio technique. We have carried out
the plane-wave pseudopotential approach within the framework of the
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) implemented within the CASTEP
code. The calculated structural parameters show a good agreement with the
experimental results. In our work we have used GGA-PBE to calculate the
electronic properties and it is found that the results exhibit similar band
structure qualitatively with the results calculated using LDA. The electronic
band structure reveals metallic conductivity and the major contribution comes
from Hf-5d states. Our results for structural and electronic properties are
compared with the experimental and other theoretical results wherever these are
available.
