 <dc:description>  In this paper, the online variants of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm are
considered. We consider minimizing the regret with a stochastic cost. The
online algorithms only require simple iterative updates and a non-adaptive step
size rule, in contrast to the hybrid schemes commonly considered in the
literature. Several new results are derived for convex and non-convex losses.
With a strongly convex stochastic cost and when the optimal solution lies in
the interior of the constraint set or the constraint set is a polytope, the
regret bound and anytime optimality are shown to be ${\cal O}( \log^3 T / T )$
and ${\cal O}( \log^2 T / T)$, respectively, where $T$ is the number of rounds
played. These results are based on an improved analysis on the stochastic
Frank-Wolfe algorithms. Moreover, the online algorithms are shown to converge
even when the loss is non-convex, i.e., the algorithms find a stationary point
to the time-varying/stochastic loss at a rate of ${\cal O}(\sqrt{1/T})$.
Numerical experiments on realistic data sets are presented to support our
theoretical claims.
