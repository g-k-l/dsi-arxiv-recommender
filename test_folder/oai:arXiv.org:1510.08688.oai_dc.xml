 <dc:description>  The NA61/SHINE experiment aims to discover the critical point of strongly
interacting matter and study the properties of the onset of deconfinement by
measurements of hadron production properties in proton-proton, proton-nucleus
and nucleus-nucleus interactions in the CERN SPS energy range.
  This contribution presents results on the energy dependence of hadron spectra
and yields as well as on fluctuations and two-particle correlations in p+p and
centrality selected Be+Be collisions. In particular, the energy dependence of
the signal of deconfinement, the "horn", observed in central Pb+Pb collisions
is compared with the corresponding results from p+p interactions. Also
string-hadronic models are tested using hadron spectra and fluctuations
measured in p+p interactions. Results on fluctuations (multiplicity and
transverse momentum) are presented as a function of the collision energy for
Be+Be and p+p collisions in search for the critical point of strongly
interacting matter.
