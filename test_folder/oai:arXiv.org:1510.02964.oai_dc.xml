 <dc:description>  Let $E$ be a vector bundle on a smooth complex projective variety $X$. We
study the family of sections $s_t\in H^0(E\otimes L_t)$ where $L_t\in Pic^0(X)$
is a family of topologically trivial line bundle and $L_0=\mathcal O_X,$ that
is, we study deformations of $s=s_0$. By applying the approximation theorem of
Artin [2] we give a transversality condition that generalizes the
semi-regularity of an effective Cartier divisor. Moreover, we obtain another
proof of the Severi-Kodaira-Spencer theorem [4]. We apply our results to give a
lower bound to the continuous rank of a vector bundle as defined by Miguel
Barja [3] and a proof of a piece of the generic vanishing theorems [6] and [7]
for the canonical bundle. We extend also to higher dimension a result given in
[8] on the base locus of the paracanonical base locus for surfaces.
