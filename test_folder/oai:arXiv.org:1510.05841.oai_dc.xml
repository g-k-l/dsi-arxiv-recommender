 <dc:description>  We introduce a new variation of the m-player asymmetric Colonel Blotto game,
where the n battles occur as sequential stages of the game, and the winner of
each stage needs to spend resources for maintaining his win. The limited
resources of the players are thus needed both for increasing the probability of
winning and for the maintenance costs. We show that if the initial resources of
the players are not too small, then the game has a unique Nash equilibrium, and
the given equilibrium strategies guarantee the given expected payoff for each
player.
