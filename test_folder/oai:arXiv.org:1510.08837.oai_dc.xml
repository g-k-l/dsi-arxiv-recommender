 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the cosmic frequency of technological species.
Recent advances in exoplanet studies provide strong constraints on all
astrophysical terms in the Drake Equation. Using these and modifying the form
and intent of the Drake equation we show that we can set a firm lower bound on
the probability that one or more additional technological species have evolved
anywhere and at any time in the history of the observable Universe. We find
that as long as the probability that a habitable zone planet develops a
technological species is larger than ~$10^{-24}$, then humanity is not the only
time technological intelligence has evolved. This constraint has important
scientific and philosophical consequences.
