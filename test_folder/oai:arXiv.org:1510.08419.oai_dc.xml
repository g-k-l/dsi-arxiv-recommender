 <dc:description>  We present a method for synthesizing recursive functions that provably
satisfy a given specification in the form of a polymorphic refinement type. We
observe that such specifications are particularly suitable for program
synthesis for two reasons. First, they offer a unique combination of expressive
power and decidability, which enables automatic verification---and hence
synthesis---of nontrivial programs. Second, a type-based specification for a
program can often be effectively decomposed into independent specifications for
its components, causing the synthesizer to consider fewer component
combinations and leading to a combinatorial reduction in the size of the search
space. At the core of our synthesis procedure is a new algorithm for refinement
type checking, which supports specification decomposition.
  We have evaluated our prototype implementation on a large set of synthesis
problems and found that it exceeds the state of the art in terms of both
scalability and usability. The tool was able to synthesize more complex
programs than those reported in prior work (several sorting algorithms and
operations on balanced search trees), as well as most of the benchmarks tackled
by existing synthesizers, often starting from a more concise and intuitive user
input.
