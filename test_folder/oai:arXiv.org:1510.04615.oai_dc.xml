 <dc:description>  We compare evolutionary predictions of double compact object merger rate
densities with initial and forthcoming LIGO/Virgo upper limits. We find that:
(i) Due to the cosmological reach of advanced detectors, current conversion
methods of population synthesis predictions into merger rate densities are
insufficient. (ii) Our optimistic models are a factor of 18 below the initial
LIGO/Virgo upper limits for BH-BH systems, indicating that a modest increase in
observational sensitivity (by a factor of 2.5) may bring the first detections
or first gravitational wave constraints on binary evolution. (iii)
Stellar-origin massive BH-BH mergers should dominate event rates in advanced
LIGO/Virgo and can be detected out to redshift z=2 with templates including
inspiral, merger, and ringdown. Normal stars (&lt;150 Msun) can produce such
mergers with total redshifted mass up to 400 Msun. (iv) High black hole natal
kicks can severely limit the formation of massive BH-BH systems (both in
isolated binary and in dynamical dense cluster evolution), and thus would
eliminate detection of these systems even at full advanced LIGO/Virgo
sensitivity. We find that low and high black hole natal kicks are allowed by
current observational electromagnetic constraints. (v) The majority of our
models yield detections of all types of mergers (NS-NS, BH-NS, BH-BH) with
advanced detectors. Numerous massive BH-BH merger detections will indicate
small (if any) natal kicks for massive BHs.
