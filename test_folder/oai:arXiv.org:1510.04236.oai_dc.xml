 <dc:description>  Depletion interactions arise from entropic forces, and their ability to
induce aggregation and even ordering of colloidal particles through
self-assembly is well established, especially for spherical colloids. We vary
the size and concentration of penetrable hard sphere depletants in a system of
cuboctahedra, and we show how depletion changes the preferential facet
alignment of the colloids and thereby selects different crystal structures.
Moreover, we explain the cuboctahedra phase behavior using perturbative free
energy calculations. We find that cuboctahedra can form a stable simple cubic
phase, and, remarkably, that the stability of this phase can only be
rationalized by considering the effects of both the colloid and depletant
entropy. We corroborate our results by analyzing how the depletant
concentration and size affect the emergent directional entropic forces and
hence the effective particle shape. We propose the use of depletants as a means
of easily changing the effective shape of self-assembling anisotropic colloids.
