 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach for computing reduced density matrices for
superpositions of eigenstates of a Bethe-ansatz solvable model by direct
integration of the wave function in coordinate representation. A diagrammatic
approach is developed to keep track of relevant terms and identify symmetries,
which helps to reduce the number of terms that have to be evaluated
numerically. As a first application we compute with modest numerical resources
the one-body density matrix and its eigenvalues including the condensate
fraction for a quantum bright soliton with N = 10 bosons. The latter are
constructed as superpositions of string-type Bethe-ansatz eigenstates of
nonrelatvistic bosons in one spatial dimension with attractive contact
interaction. Upon delocalising the superposition in momentum space we find that
the condensate fraction saturates to a value close to one. The presented
approach is suitable for studying time-dependent problems and generalises to
higher-order correlation functions.
