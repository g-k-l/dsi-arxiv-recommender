 <dc:description>  We study the energy loss rate (ELR) of the accelerated quark in terms of the
holographic models for the two different motions, linear acceleration and
uniform rotation. They are examined by two different non-conformal models with
confinement. We found in both models that the value of ELR is bounded from
below by the string tension of the linear confinement potential between quark
and anti-quark. The lower bounds of ELR are independent of the types of the
motion of the quark. They are determined by the string tension at the world
sheet horizon of the model. These results are obtained when the model has the
diagonal background metric.
