 <dc:description>  Many early universe theories predict the creation of Primordial Black Holes
(PBHs). PBHs could have masses ranging from the Planck mass to 10^5 solar
masses or higher depending on the size of the universe at formation. A Black
Hole (BH) has a Hawking temperature which is inversely proportional to its
mass. Hence a sufficiently small BH will quasi-thermally radiate particles at
an ever-increasing rate as emission lowers its mass and raises its temperature.
The final moments of this evaporation phase should be explosive and its
description is dependent on the particle physics model. In this work we
investigate the final few seconds of BH evaporation, using the Standard Model
and incorporating the most recent Large Hadron Collider (LHC) results, and
provide a new parameterization for the instantaneous emission spectrum. We
calculate for the first time energy-dependent PBH burst light curves in the
GeV/TeV energy range. Moreover, we explore PBH burst search methods and
potential observational PBH burst signatures. We have found a unique signature
in the PBH burst light curves that may be detectable by GeV/TeV gamma-ray
observatories such as the High Altitude Water Cerenkov (HAWC) observatory. The
implications of beyond the Standard Model theories on the PBH burst
observational characteristics are also discussed, including potential
sensitivity of the instantaneous photon detection rate to a squark threshold in
the 5 -10 TeV range.
