 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the termination problem of a family of
polynomial programs, in which all assignments to program variables are
polynomials, and test conditions of loops and conditional statements are
polynomial equations. Our main result is that the non-terminating inputs of
such a polynomial program is algorithmically computable according to a strictly
descending chain of algebraic sets, which implies that the termination problem
of these programs is decidable. The complexity of the algorithm follows
immediately from the length of the chain, which can be computed by Hilbert's
function and Macaulay's theorem. To the best of our knowledge, the considered
family of polynomial programs should be the largest one with a decidable
termination problem so far. The experimental results indicate the efficiency of
our approach.
