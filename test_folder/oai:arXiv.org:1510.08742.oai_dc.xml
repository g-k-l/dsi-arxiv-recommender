 <dc:description>  The next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections to $pp\to
l^+l^-/\bar\nu\nu+\gamma+X$ production, including all off-shell effects of
intermediate Z bosons in the complex-mass scheme, are calculated for LHC
energies, revealing the typically expected large corrections of tens of percent
in the TeV range. Contributions from quark-photon and photon-photon initial
states are taken into account as well, but their impact is found to be moderate
or small. Moreover, the known next-to-leading-order QCD corrections are
reproduced. In order to separate hard photons from jets, both a quark-to-photon
fragmentation function \'a la Glover/Morgan and Frixione's cone isolation are
employed. The calculation is available in the form of Monte Carlo programs
allowing for the evaluation of arbitrary differential cross sections.
Predictions for integrated cross sections are presented for the LHC at 7 TeV, 8
TeV, and 14 TeV, and differential distributions are discussed at 14 TeV for
bare muons and dressed leptons. Finally, we consider the impact of anomalous
$ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma$ couplings.
