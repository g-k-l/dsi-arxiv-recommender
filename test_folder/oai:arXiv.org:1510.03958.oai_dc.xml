 <dc:description>  In general, it is difficult to evaluate measurement errors when the initial
and final conditions of the measurement make it impossible to identify the
correct value of the target observable. Ozawa proposed a solution based on the
operator algebra of observables which has recently been used in experiments
investigating the error-disturbance trade-off of quantum measurements.
Importantly, this solution makes surprisingly detailed statements about the
relations between measurement outcomes and the unknown target observable. In
the present paper, we investigate this relation by performing a sequence of two
measurements on the polarization of a photon, so that the first measurement
commutes with the target observable and the second measurement is sensitive to
a complementary observable. While the initial measurement can be evaluated
using classical statistics, the second measurement introduces the effects of
quantum correlations between the non-commuting physical properties. By varying
the resolution of the initial measurement, we can change the relative
contribution of the non-classical correlations and identify their role in the
evaluation of the quantum measurement. It is shown that the most striking
deviation from classical expectations is obtained at the transition between
weak and strong measurements, where the competition between different
statistical effects results in measurement values well outside the range of
possible eigenvalues.
