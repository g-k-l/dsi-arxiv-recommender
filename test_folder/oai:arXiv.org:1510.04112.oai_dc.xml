 <dc:description>  Gaussian quantum systems capture many important quantum features, but can be
simulated classically. Using both the Koopmanian and phase-space formalisms we
investigate how robust this classicality is. We find from both perspectives
that failures of consistency of the dynamics of a hybrid classical-quantum
system are exhibited. By demanding that no unobservable operators couple to the
quantum sector in the Koopmanian formalism, we show that the classical
equations of motion act on their quantum counterparts without experiencing any
back-reaction, resulting in non-conservation of energy in the quantum system.
Using the phase-space formalism we study the short time evolution of the moment
equations of a hybrid classical-Gaussian quantum system, and observe violations
of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation in the quantum sector for a broad range
of initial conditions. This inconsistency indicates that while many explicitly
quantum effects can be represented classically, quantum aspects of the system
cannot be fully masked. We comment on the implications of our results for
quantum gravity.
