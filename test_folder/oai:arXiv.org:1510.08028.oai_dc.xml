 <dc:description>  Optical limiters transmit low-intensity light, while blocking laser radiation
with excessively high intensity or fluence. A typical passive optical limiter
absorbs most of the high level radiation, which can cause irreversible damage.
In this communication we report the first experimental realization of a
reflective optical limiter, which does not absorb the high-level laser
radiation, but rather reflects it back to space. The design is based on a
periodic layered structure composed of alternating SiO2 and Si3N4 layers with a
single GaAs defect layer in the middle. At low intensities, the layered
structure displays a strong resonant transmission via the localized defect
mode. At high intensities, the two-photon absorption in the GaAs layer
suppresses the localized mode along with the resonant transmission, the entire
layered structure turns highly reflective within a broad frequency range
covering the entire photonic band gap of the periodic layered structure. By
contrast, a stand-alone GaAs layer would absorb most of the high-level
radiation, thus acting as a basic absorptive optical limiter. The proposed
design can only perform at shortwave IR, where GaAs displays negligible linear
absorption and very strong nonlinear two-photon absorption. With judicious
choice of optical materials, the same principle can be replicated for any other
frequency range.
