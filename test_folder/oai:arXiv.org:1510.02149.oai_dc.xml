 <dc:description>  This paper develops a fast distributed algorithm, termed \emph{DEXTRA}, to
solve the optimization problem when~$n$ agents reach agreement and
collaboratively minimize the sum of their local objective functions over the
network, where the communication between the agents is described by
a~\emph{directed} graph. Existing algorithms solve the problem restricted to
directed graphs with convergence rates of $O(\ln k/\sqrt{k})$ for general
convex objective functions and $O(\ln k/k)$ when the objective functions are
strongly-convex, where~$k$ is the number of iterations. We show that, with the
appropriate step-size, DEXTRA converges at a linear rate $O(\tau^{k})$ for
$0&lt;\tau&lt;1$, given that the objective functions are restricted strongly-convex.
The implementation of DEXTRA requires each agent to know its local out-degree.
Simulation examples further illustrate our findings.
