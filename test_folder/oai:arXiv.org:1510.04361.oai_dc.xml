 <dc:description>  Predictions from science and engineering models depend on several input
parameters. Global sensitivity analysis quantifies the importance of each input
parameter, which can lead to insight into the model and reduced computational
cost; commonly used sensitivity metrics include Sobol' total sensitivity
indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures. Active subspaces are
an emerging set of tools for identifying important directions in a model's
input parameter space; these directions can be exploited to reduce the model's
dimension enabling otherwise infeasible parameter studies. In this paper, we
develop global sensitivity metrics called activity scores from the active
subspace, which yield insight into the important model parameters. We
mathematically relate the activity scores to established sensitivity metrics,
and we discuss computational methods to estimate the activity scores. We show
two numerical examples with algebraic functions taken from simplified
engineering models. For each model, we analyze the active subspace and discuss
how to exploit the low-dimensional structure. We then show that input rankings
produced by the activity scores are consistent with rankings produced by the
standard metrics.
