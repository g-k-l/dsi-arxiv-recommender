 <dc:description>  The presence of a large applied magnetic field removes the degeneracy of the
vacuum energy states for spin-up and spin-down neutrons. For polarized neutron
reflectometry, this must be included in the reference potential energy of the
Schr\"odinger equation that is used to calculate the expected scattering from a
magnetic layered structure. For samples with magnetization that is purely
parallel or antiparallel to the applied field which defines the quantization
axis, there is no mixing of the spin states (no spin-flip scattering) and so
this additional potential is constant throughout the scattering region. When
there is non-collinear magnetization in the sample however, there will be
significant scattering from one spin state into the other and the reference
potentials will differ between the incoming and outgoing wavefunctions,
changing the angle and intensities of the scattering. The theory of the
scattering and recommended experimental practices for this type of measurement
are presented, as well as an example measurement.
