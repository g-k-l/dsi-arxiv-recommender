 <dc:description>  Amorphous packings of spheres have been intensely investigated in order to
understand the mechanical and flow behaviour of dense granular matter, and to
explore universal aspects of the transition from fluid to structurally arrested
or jammed states. Considerable attention has recently been focussed on
anisotropic packings of frictional grains generated by shear deformation
leading to shear jamming, which occurs below the jamming density for isotropic
packings of frictionless grains. With the aim of disentangling the role of
shear deformation induced structures and friction in generating shear jamming,
we study sheared assemblies of frictionless spheres computationally, over a
wide range of densities, extending far below the isotropic jamming point. We
demonstrate the emergence of a variety of geometric features characteristic of
jammed packings with the increase of shear strain. The average contact number
and the distributions of contact forces suggest the presence of a threshold
density, well below the isotropic jamming point, above which a qualitative
change occurs in the jamming behaviour of sheared configurations. We show that
above this threshold density, friction stabilizes the sheared configurations we
generate. Our results thus reveal the emergence of geometric features
characteristic of jammed states as a result of shear deformation alone, while
friction is instrumental in stabilising packings over a range of densities
below the isotropic jamming point.
