 <dc:description>  Approximate counting via correlation decay is the core algorithmic technique
used in the sharp delineation of the computational phase transition that arises
in the approximation of the partition function of anti-ferromagnetic two-spin
models.
  Previous analyses of correlation-decay algorithms implicitly depended on the
occurrence of strong spatial mixing (SSM). This means that one uses worst-case
analysis of the recursive procedure that creates the sub-instances. We develop
a new analysis method that is more refined than the worst-case analysis. We
take the shape of instances in the computation tree into consideration and
amortise against certain "bad" instances that are created as the recursion
proceeds. This enables us to show correlation decay and to obtain an FPTAS even
when SSM fails.
  We apply our technique to the problem of approximately counting independent
sets in hypergraphs with degree upper-bound Delta and with a lower bound k on
the arity of hyperedges. Liu and Lin gave an FPTAS for k&gt;=2 and Delta&lt;=5 (lack
of SSM was the obstacle preventing this algorithm from being generalised to
Delta=6). Our technique gives a tight result for Delta=6, showing that there is
an FPTAS for k&gt;=3 and Delta&lt;=6. The best previously-known approximation scheme
for Delta=6 is the Markov-chain simulation based FPRAS of Bordewich, Dyer and
Karpinski, which only works for k&gt;=8.
  Our technique also applies for larger values of k, giving an FPTAS for
k&gt;=Delta. This bound is not substantially stronger than existing randomised
results in the literature. Nevertheless, it gives the first deterministic
approximation scheme in this regime. Moreover, unlike existing results, it
leads to an FPTAS for counting dominating sets in regular graphs with
sufficiently large degree.
  We further demonstrate that approximately counting independent sets in
hypergraphs is NP-hard even within the uniqueness regime.

 <dc:description>Comment: This version improves the bound in Theorem 3 from k&gt;=1.66Delta to
  k&gt;=Delta, which is used in the proof of the (new) Corollary 4</dc:description>
