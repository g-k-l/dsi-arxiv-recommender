 <dc:title>On the Geometrization of Quantum Mechanics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is commonly formulated in terms of
wavefunctions (probability amplitudes) obeying the static and the
time-dependent Schroedinger equations (SE). Despite the success of this
representation of the quantum world a wave-particle duality concept is required
to reconcile the theory with observations (experimental measurements). A first
solution to this dichotomy was introduced in the de Broglie-Bohm theory
according to which a pilot wave (solution of the SE) is guiding the evolution
of particle trajectories. Here, I propose a geometrization of quantum mechanics
that describes the time evolution of particles as geodesic lines in a curved
space, whose curvature is induced by the quantum potential. This formulation
allows therefore the incorporation of all quantum effects into the geometry of
space-time, as it is the case for gravitation in the general relativity.
