 <dc:title>Rotating nuclei: from ground state to the extremes of spin and
  deformation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The rotating nuclei represent one of most interesting subjects for
theoretical and experimental studies. They open a new dimension of nuclear
landscape, namely, spin direction. Contrary to the majority of nuclear systems,
their properties sensitively depend on time-odd mean fields and currents in
density functional theories. Moreover, they show a considerable interplay of
collective and single-particle degrees of freedom. In this chapter, I discuss
the basic features of the description of rotating nuclei in one-dimensional
cranking approximation of covariant density functional theory. The successes of
this approach to the description of rotating nuclei at low spin in pairing
regime and at high spin in unpaired regime in wide range of deformations (from
normal to hyperdeformation) are illustrated. I also discuss the recent progress
and open questions in our understanding of the role of proton-neutron pairing
in rotating nuclei at $N\approx Z$, the physics of band termination and other
phenomena in rotating nuclei.
