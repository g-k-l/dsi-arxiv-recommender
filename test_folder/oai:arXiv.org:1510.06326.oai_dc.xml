 <dc:description>  The access to an ever increasing amount of information in the modern world
gave rise to the development of many quantitative indicators about urban
regions in the globe. Therefore, there is a growing need for a precise
definition of how to delimit urban regions, so as to allow proper respective
characterization and modeling. Here we present a straightforward methodology to
automatically detect urban region borders around a single seed point. The
method is based on a diffusion process having street crossings and terminations
as source points. We exemplify the potential of the methodology by
characterizing the geometry and topology of 21 urban regions obtained from 8
distinct countries. The geometry is studied by employing the lacunarity
measurement, which is associated to the regularity of holes contained in a
pattern. The topology is analyzed by associating the betweenness centrality of
the streets with their respective class, such as motorway or residential,
obtained from a database.
