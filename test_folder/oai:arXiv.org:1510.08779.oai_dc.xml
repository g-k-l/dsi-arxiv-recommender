 <dc:description>  $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs, originally conceived by Gromov in 1987, include
non-trivial interesting classes of "non-expander" graphs; for fixed $\delta$,
such graphs are simply called hyperbolic graphs. Our goal in this paper is to
study the effect of the hyperbolicity measure $\delta$ on expansion and
cut-size bounds on graphs (here $\delta$ need not be a constant, i.e., the
graph is not necessarily hyperbolic), and investigate up to what values of
$\delta$ these results could provide improved approximation algorithms for
related combinatorial problems. To this effect, we provide the following
results.
  (a) We provide constructive bounds on node expansions and cut-sizes for
$\delta$-hyperbolic graphs as a function of $\delta$, and show that witnesses
for such non-expansion or cut-size can be computed efficiently in polynomial
time. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such constructive
bounds proven. We also show how to find a large family of s-t cuts with small
number of cut-edges when s and t are sufficiently far apart.
  (b) We also provide the following algorithmic consequences of these bounds
and their related proof techniques for a few problems related to cuts and paths
for $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs (where $\delta$ need not necessarily a constant
but may be a function f of the number of nodes, the exact nature of growth of f
depends on the problem considered):
  (b-1) We provide improved approximation algorithms for minimizing the number
of bottleneck edges that arises in network design applications. En route, we
also formulate the hitting set problem of size-constrained cuts and show a
connection between approximability issues of these two problems.
  (b-2) We provide a polynomial-time solution for a type of small-set expansion
problem that arises in the investigation of unique games conjecture.

 <dc:description>Comment: Includes changes: Clarified that motivation is not just to study
  hyperbolic graphs (constant \delta), but study as \delta\ varies with n, in
  which case topology can be far from tree. Noted that vulnerability problem is
  network design application where greedy fails. Clarified that SSE solution
  works for non-constant \delta\ if degree is restricted. Added to reference
  seminal result of Kleinberg</dc:description>
