 <dc:description>  In the present work, we theoretically demonstrate that near field radiative
transport between one dimensional periodic grating microstructures separated by
nanometer vacuum gaps can be spectrally enhanced by exciting magnetic
polariton. Fluctuational electrodynamics that incorporates scattering matrix
theory with rigorous coupled wave analysis is employed to exactly calculate the
near field radiative flux between two gold gratings. Besides the well known
coupled surface plasmon polaritons, the radiative flux can be also spectrally
enhanced due to magnetic polariton, which is excited in the gap between gold
ridges. The mechanisms of magnetic polariton in the near field radiative
transport are elucidated in detail, while the unusual enhancement cannot be
predicted by either the Derjaguin or effective medium approximations. The
effects of vacuum gap distance and grating geometry parameters between the two
gratings are investigated. The findings will open up a new way to control near
field radiative transfer by magnetic polariton with micro or nanostructured
metamaterials.
