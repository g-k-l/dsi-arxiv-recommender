 <dc:description>  The localization characters of the first-order rogue wave (RW) solution $u$
of the Kundu-Eckhaus equation is studied in this paper.
  We discover a full process of the evolution for the contour line with height
$c^2+d$ along the orthogonal direction of the ($t,x$)-plane for a first-order
RW $|u|^2$: A point at height $9c^2$ generates a convex curve for $3c^2\leq
d&lt;8c^2$, whereas it becomes a concave curve for $0&lt;d&lt;3c^2$, next it reduces to
a hyperbola on asymptotic plane (i.e. equivalently $d=0$), and the two branches
of the hyperbola become two separate convex curves when $-c^2&lt;d&lt;0$, and finally
they reduce to two separate points at $d=-c^2$. Using the contour line method,
the length, width, and area of the RW at height $c^2+d (0&lt;d&lt;8c^2)$ , i.e. above
the asymptotic plane, are defined. We study the evolutions of three
above-mentioned localization characters on $d$ through analytical and visual
methods. The phase difference between the Kundu-Eckhaus and the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation is also given by an explicit formula.

  difference between the KE and the NLS. This version has been accepted by
