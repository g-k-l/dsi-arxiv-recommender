 <dc:description>  Momentum dissipation is an important ingredient in condensed matter physics
that requires a translation breaking sector. In the bottom-up gauge/gravity
duality, this implies that the gravity dual is massive. We start here a
systematic analysis of holographic massive gravity (HMG) theories, which admit
field theory dual interpretations and which, therefore, might store interesting
condensed matter applications. We show that there are many phases of HMG that
are fully consistent effective field theories and which have been left
overlooked in the literature. The most important distinction between the
different HMG phases is that they can be clearly separated into solids and
fluids. This can be done both at the level of the unbroken spacetime symmetries
as well as concerning the elastic properties of the dual materials. We extract
the modulus of rigidity of the solid HMG black brane solutions and show how it
relates to the graviton mass term. We also consider the implications of the
different HMGs on the electric response. We show that the types of response
that can be consistently described within this framework is much wider than
what is captured by the narrow class of models mostly considered so far.
