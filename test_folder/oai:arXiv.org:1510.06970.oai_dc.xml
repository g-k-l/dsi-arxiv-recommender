 <dc:description>  It was shown in \cite{DVV} for $2d$ topological Conformal field theory (TCFT)
\cite{EY,W} and more recently in \cite{BSZ}-\cite{BB2} for the non-critical
String theory \cite{P}-\cite{BAlZ} that a number of models of these two types
can be exactly solved using their connection with the Frobenius manifold (FM)
structure introduced by Dubrovin\cite{Dub}. More precisely these models are
connected with a special case of FMs, so called Saito Frobenius manifolds
(SFM)\cite{Saito} (originally called Flat structure together with the Flat
coordinate system), which arise on the space of the versal deformations of the
isolated Singularities after choosing of a suitabe so-called Primitive form,
and which also arises on the quotient spaces by reflection groups. In this
paper we explore the connection of the models of TCFT and non-critical String
theory with SFM. The crucial point for obtaining an explicit expression for the
correlators is finding the flat coordinates of SFMs as functions of the
parameters of the deformed singularity. We suggest a direct way to find the
flat coordinates, using the integral representation for the solutions of
Gauss-Manin system connected with the corresponding SFM for a simple
singularity. Also, we address the possible generalization of our approach for
the models investigated in \cite{Gep} which are ${SU(N)_k}/({SU(N-1)_{k+1}
\times U(1)})$ Kazama-Suzuki theories \cite{KS}.
