 <dc:description>  Although climate change and energy are intricately linked, their explicit
connection is not always prominent in public discourse and the media.
Disruptive extreme weather events, including hurricanes, focus public attention
in new and different ways, offering a unique window of opportunity to analyze
how a focusing event influences public discourse. Media coverage of extreme
weather events simultaneously shapes and reflects public discourse on climate
issues. Here we analyze climate and energy newspaper coverage of Hurricanes
Katrina (2005) and Sandy (2012) using topic models, mathematical techniques
used to discover abstract topics within a set of documents. Our results
demonstrate that post-Katrina media coverage does not contain a climate change
topic, and the energy topic is limited to discussion of energy prices, markets,
and the economy with almost no explicit linkages made between energy and
climate change. In contrast, post-Sandy media coverage does contain a prominent
climate change topic, a distinct energy topic, as well as integrated
representation of climate change and energy, indicating a shift in climate and
energy reporting between Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.
