 <dc:description>  The lack of reliable data in developing countries is a major obstacle to
sustainable development, food security, and disaster relief. Poverty data, for
example, is typically scarce, sparse in coverage, and labor-intensive to
obtain. Remote sensing data such as high-resolution satellite imagery, on the
other hand, is becoming increasingly available and inexpensive. Unfortunately,
such data is highly unstructured and currently no techniques exist to
automatically extract useful insights to inform policy decisions and help
direct humanitarian efforts. We propose a novel machine learning approach to
extract large-scale socioeconomic indicators from high-resolution satellite
imagery. The main challenge is that training data is very scarce, making it
difficult to apply modern techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN). We therefore propose a transfer learning approach where nighttime light
intensities are used as a data-rich proxy. We train a fully convolutional CNN
model to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery, simultaneously learning
features that are useful for poverty prediction. The model learns filters
identifying different terrains and man-made structures, including roads,
buildings, and farmlands, without any supervision beyond nighttime lights. We
demonstrate that these learned features are highly informative for poverty
mapping, even approaching the predictive performance of survey data collected
in the field.
