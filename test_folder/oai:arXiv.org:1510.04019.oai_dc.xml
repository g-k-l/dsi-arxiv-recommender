 <dc:description>  In order to investigate the interaction between single vacancies in a
graphene sheet, we have used spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT).
Two distinct configurations were considered, either with the two vacancies
located in the same sublattice or in different sublattices, and the effect of
changing the separation between the vacancies was also studied. Our results
show that the ground state of the system is indeed magnetic, but the presence
of the vacancies in the same sublattice or in different sublattices and the
possible topological configurations can lead to different contributions from
the $\pi$ and $\sigma$ orbitals to magnetism. On the other hand, our findings
reveal that the net magnetic moment of the system with the two vacancies in the
same sublattice move towards the value of the magnetic moment per isolated
vacancy with the increase of the distance between the vacancies, which is
ascribed to the different contributions due to $\pi$ electrons. Moreover, it is
also found that the local magnetic moments for vacancies in the same sublattice
are in parallel configuration, while they have different orientations when the
vacancies are created in different sublattices. So, our findings have clearly
evidenced how difficult it would be to observe experimentally the emergence of
magnetic order in graphene-based systems containing randomly created atomic
vacancies, since the energy difference between cases of antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic order decreases quickly with the increase in the distance
separating each vacancy pair.
