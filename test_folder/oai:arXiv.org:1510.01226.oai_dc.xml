 <dc:description>  We report the discovery of transient radio emission from the nearby
optically-discovered TDE ASASSN-14li (distance of 90 Mpc), making it the first
typical TDE detected in the radio, and unambiguously pointing to the formation
of a non-relativistic outflow with a kinetic energy of $\approx
(4-10)\times10^{47}$ erg, a velocity of $\approx 12,000-36,000$ km s$^{-1}$,
and a mass of $\approx 3\times10^{-5}-7\times10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that
the outflow was ejected on 2014 August 11--25, in agreement with an independent
estimate of the timing of super-Eddington accretion based on the optical, UV,
and X-ray observations, and that the ejected mass corresponds to about $1-10\%$
of the mass accreted in the super-Eddington phase. The temporal evolution of
the radio emission also uncovers the circumnuclear density profile,
$\rho(R)\propto R^{-2.5}$ on a scale of about 0.01 pc, a scale that cannot be
probed via direct measurements even in the nearest SMBHs. Our discovery of
radio emission from the nearest well-studied TDE to date, with a radio
luminosity lower than all previous limits, indicates that non-relativistic
outflows are ubiquitous in TDEs, and that future, more sensitive, radio surveys
will uncover similar events.
