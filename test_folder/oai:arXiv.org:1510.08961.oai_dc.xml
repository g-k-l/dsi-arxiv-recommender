 <dc:description>  The accurate absolute surface energies of (0001)/(000-1) surfaces of wurtzite
structures are crucial in determining the thin film growth mode of important
energy materials. However, the surface energies still remain to be solved due
to the intrinsic difficulty of calculating dangling bond energy of
asymmetrically bonded surface atoms. In this study, we used a pseudo-hydrogen
passivation method to estimate the dangling bond energy and calculate the polar
surfaces of ZnO and GaN. The calculations were based on the pseudo chemical
potentials obtained from a set of tetrahedral clusters or simple
pseudo-molecules, using density functional theory approaches. And the surface
energies of (0001)/(000-1) surfaces of wurtzite ZnO and GaN we obtained showed
relatively high self-consistencies. A wedge structure calculation with a new
bottom surface passivation scheme of group I and group VII elements was also
proposed and performed to show converged absolute surface energy of wurtzite
ZnO polar surfaces, and the result were also compared with the above method.
These calculations and comparisons may provide important insights to crystal
growths of the above materials, thereby leading to significant performance
enhancements of semiconductor devices.
