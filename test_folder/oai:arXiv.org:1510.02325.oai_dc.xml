 <dc:description>  Deformability is a central feature of many types of microswimmers, e.g. for
artificially generated self-propelled droplets. Here, we analyze deformable
bead-spring microswimmers in an externally imposed solvent flow field as simple
theoretical model systems. We focus on their behavior in a circular swirl flow
in two spatial dimensions. Linear (straight) two-bead swimmers are found to
circle around the swirl with a slight drift to the outside with increasing
activity. In contrast to that, we observe for triangular three-bead or
square-like four-bead swimmers a tendency of being drawn into the swirl and
finally getting drowned, although a radial inward component is absent in the
flow field. During one cycle around the swirl, the self-propulsion direction of
an active triangular or square-like swimmer remains almost constant, while
their orbits become deformed exhibiting an ``egg-like'' shape. Over time, the
swirl flow induces slight net rotations of these swimmer types, which leads to
net rotations of the egg-shaped orbits. Interestingly, in certain cases, the
orbital rotation changes sense when the swimmer approaches the flow
singularity. Our predictions can be verified in real-space experiments on
artificial microswimmers.
