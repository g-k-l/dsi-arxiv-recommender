 <dc:description>  In this work we extend, review and jointly discuss earlier experiments
conducted by us in hyperaged geological glasses, either in Dominican amber (20
million years old) or in Spanish amber from El Soplao (110 million years old).
After characterization of their thermodynamic and elastic properties (using
Differential Scanning Calorimetry around the glass-transition temperature, and
measuring mass density and sound velocity), their specific heat was measured at
low and very low temperatures. By directly comparing pristine amber samples
(i.e. highly stabilized polymer glasses after aging for millions of years) to
the same samples after being totally or partially rejuvenated, we have found
that the two most prominent universal anomalous low-temperature properties of
glasses, namely the tunnelling two-level systems and the so-called boson peak,
persist essentially unchanged in both types of hyperaged geological glasses.
Therefore, non-Debye low-energy excitations of glasses appear to be robust,
intrinsic properties of non-crystalline solids which do not vanish by accessing
to very deep states in the potential energy landscape.
