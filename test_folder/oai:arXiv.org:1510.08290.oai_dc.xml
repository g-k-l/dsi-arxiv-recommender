 <dc:description>  We consider uniformly elliptic coefficient fields that are randomly
distributed according to a stationary ensemble of a finite range of dependence.
We show that the gradient and flux $(\nabla\phi,a(\nabla \phi+e))$ of the
corrector $\phi$, when spatially averaged over a scale $R\gg 1$ decay like the
CLT scaling $R^{-\frac{d}{2}}$. We establish this optimal rate on the level of
sub-Gaussian bounds in terms of the stochastic integrability, and also
establish a suboptimal rate on the level of optimal Gaussian bounds in terms of
the stochastic integrability. The proof unravels and exploits the
self-averaging property of the associated semi-group, which provides a natural
and convenient disintegration of scales, and culminates in a propagator
estimate with strong stochastic integrability. As an application, we
characterize the fluctuations of the homogenization commutator, and prove sharp
bounds on the spatial growth of the corrector, a quantitative two-scale
expansion, and several other estimates of interest in homogenization.

 <dc:description>Comment: 114 pages. Revised version with some new results: optimal scaling
  with nearly-optimal stochastic integrability on top of nearly-optimal scaling
  with optimal stochastic integrability, CLT for the homogenization commutator,
  and several estimates on growth of the extended corrector, semi-group
  estimates, and systematic errors</dc:description>
