 <dc:description>  Based on the Frenkel-charge transfer (CT) mixing model of singlet fission
(SF), we incorporate both the local and nonlocal phonon baths in the
Hamiltonian and adopt the algorithm of time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group to simulate the fission process in tetracene. The
endergonic SF is found to be facilitated by the robust quantum coherence, which
concurrently gives rise to a notable quantum beating effect. Controlled by the
nonlocal electron-phonon coupling, the density of triplet yield manifests a
nonlinear relationship with the singlet density. As a result, the fission rate
in tetracene is explicitly obtained, which is in agreement with the
experimental measurement.
