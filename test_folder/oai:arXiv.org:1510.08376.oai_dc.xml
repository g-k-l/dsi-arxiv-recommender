 <dc:description>  We theoretically study the phenomenon of self-propulsion through Casimir
forces in thermal non-equilibrium. Using fluctuational electrodynamics, we
derive a formula for the self-propulsion force for an arbitrary small object in
two scenarios, i) for the object being isolated, and ii) for the object being
close to a planar surface. In the latter case, the self-propulsion force (i.e.,
the force parallel to the surface) increases with decreasing distance, i.e., it
couples to the near-field. We numerically calculate the lateral force acting on
a hot spheroid near a surface and show that it can be as large as the
gravitational force, thus being potentially measurable in fly-by experiments.
We close by linking our results to well-known relations of linear response
theory in fluctuational electrodynamics: Looking at the friction of the
anisotropic object for constant velocity, we identify a correction term that is
additional to the typically used approach.
