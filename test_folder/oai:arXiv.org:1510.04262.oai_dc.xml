 <dc:description>  Recently, there has been substantial interest in realizations of skyrmions,
in particular in 2D systems due to increased stability resulting from reduced
dimensionality. A stable skyrmion, representing the smallest realizable
magnetic texture, could be an ideal element for ultra-dense magnetic memories.
Here, we use the most general form of the 2D free energy with
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions constructed from general symmetry
considerations reflecting the underlying system. We predict that skyrmion phase
is robust and it is present even when the system lacks the in-plane rotational
symmetry. In fact, the lowered symmetry leads to increased stability of
vortex-antivortex lattices with four-fold symmetry and in-plane spirals, in
some instances even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results
relate different hexagonal and square cell phases to the symmetries of
materials used for realizations of skyrmions. This will give clear directions
for experimental realizations of hexagonal and square cell phases, and will
allow engineering of skyrmions with unusual properties. We also predict
striking differences in gyro-dynamics induced by spin currents for isolated
skyrmions and for crystals where spin currents can be induced by charge
carriers or by thermal magnons. We find that under certain conditions, isolated
skyrmions can move along the current without a side motion which can have
implications for realizations of magnetic memories.
