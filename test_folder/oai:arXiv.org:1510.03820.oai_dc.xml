 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently achieved remarkably strong
performance on the practically important task of sentence classification (kim
2014, kalchbrenner 2014, johnson 2014). However, these models require
practitioners to specify an exact model architecture and set accompanying
hyperparameters, including the filter region size, regularization parameters,
and so on. It is currently unknown how sensitive model performance is to
changes in these configurations for the task of sentence classification. We
thus conduct a sensitivity analysis of one-layer CNNs to explore the effect of
architecture components on model performance; our aim is to distinguish between
important and comparatively inconsequential design decisions for sentence
classification. We focus on one-layer CNNs (to the exclusion of more complex
models) due to their comparative simplicity and strong empirical performance,
which makes it a modern standard baseline method akin to Support Vector Machine
(SVMs) and logistic regression. We derive practical advice from our extensive
empirical results for those interested in getting the most out of CNNs for
sentence classification in real world settings.
