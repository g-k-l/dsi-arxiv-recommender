 <dc:description>  We study amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from wavelength-scale composite
bodies--complicated arrangements of active and passive media--demonstrating
highly directional and tunable radiation patterns, depending strongly on pump
conditions, materials, and object shapes. For instance, we show that under
large enough gain, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric dielectric spheres radiate mostly
along either active or passive regions, depending on the gain distribution. Our
predictions are based on a recently proposed fluctuating volume--current (FVC)
formulation of electromagnetic radiation that can handle inhomogeneities in the
dielectric and fluctuation statistics of active media, e.g. arising from the
presence of non-uniform pump or material properties, which we exploit to
demonstrate an approach to modelling ASE in regimes where Purcell effect (PE)
has a significant impact on the gain, leading to spatial dispersion and/or
changes in power requirements. The nonlinear feedback of PE on the active
medium, captured by the Maxwell--Bloch equations but often ignored in linear
formulations of ASE, is introduced into our linear framework by a
self-consistent renormalization of the (dressed) gain parameters, requiring the
solution of a large system of nonlinear equations involving many linear
scattering calculations.
