 <dc:description>  The position of a colloidal particle trapped in an external field thermally
fluctuates at the equilibrium. As is well known, the ambient fluid is not a
simple heat bath and a moving particle appears heavier, which influences the
mean square velocity of the particle. When the ambient fluid is a near-critical
binary fluid mixture, the profile of the concentration difference does not
follow the particle motion totally, which is expected to influence the mean
square displacement of the particle. We calculate the influence in a simple
case, where a rigid sphere fluctuates with small amplitude, the mixture in the
homogeneous phase is near, but not very close to, the critical point, and the
particle surface attracts one component weakly. What we calculate is an
equal-time correlation, but we utilize the hydrodynamics in the limit of no
dissipation to examine the contribution from the ambient fluid. According to
our result, the mean square displacement is reduced by the additional stress,
including the osmotic pressure, due to the ambient near-criticality combined
with the preferential attraction.
