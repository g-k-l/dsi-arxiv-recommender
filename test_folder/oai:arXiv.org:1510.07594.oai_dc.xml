 <dc:description>  The problem of a cold gas flowing past a stationary object is considered. It
is shown that at large distances from the obstacle the shock front forms a
parabolic solid of revolution. The interior of the shock front is obtained by
solution of the hydrodynamic equations in parabolic coordinates. The results
are verified with a hydrodynamic simulation. The drag force and expected
spectra are calculated for such shock, both in case of an optically thin and
thick media. Finally, relations to astrophysical bow shocks and other analytic
works on oblique shocks are discussed.
