 <dc:description>  Causal set non-local wave operators allow both for the definition of an
action for Causal set theory and the study of deviations from local physics
that may have interesting phenomenological consequences. It was previously
shown that, in all dimensions, the (unique) minimal discrete operators give
averaged continuum non-local operators that reduce to $\Box-R/2$ in the local
limit. Recently, dropping the constraint of minimality, it was shown that there
exist an infinite number of discrete operators satisfying basic physical
requirements and with the right local limit in flat spacetime. In this work, we
consider this entire class of Generalized Causal set d'Alembertins in curved
spacetimes and extend to them the result about the universality of the $-R/2$
factor. Finally, we comment on the relation of this result to the Einstein
Equivalence principle.
