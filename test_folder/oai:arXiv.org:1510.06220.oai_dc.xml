 <dc:description>  The Earth's magnetic field is generated by dynamo action driven by convection
in the outer core. For numerical reasons, inertial and viscous forces play an
important role in geodynamo models; however, the primary dynamical balance in
the Earth's core is believed to be between buoyancy, Coriolis and magnetic
forces. The hope has been that by setting the Ekman number to be as small as
computationally feasible, an asymptotic regime would be reached in which the
correct force balance is achieved. However, recent analyses of geodynamo models
suggest that the desired balance has still not yet been attained. Here we adopt
a complementary approach consisting of a model of rapidly rotating convection
in which inertial forces are neglected from the outset. Within this framework
we are able to construct a new branch of solutions in which the dynamo
generates a strong magnetic field that satisfies the expected force balance.
The resulting strongly magnetized convection is dramatically different to the
corresponding solutions in which the field is weak.
