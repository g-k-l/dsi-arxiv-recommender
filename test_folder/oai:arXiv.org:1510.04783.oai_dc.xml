 <dc:description>  In this paper, we derive the standard model with classical conformal
invariance from the Yang--Mills--Higgs model in noncommutative geometry (NCG).
In the ordinary context of the NCG, the {\it distance matrix} $M_{nm}$ which
corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of Higgs fields is taken to be
finite. However, since $M_{nm}$ is arbitrary in this formulation, we can take
all $M_{nm}$ to be zero. In the original composite scheme, the Higgs field
itself vanishes with the condition $M_{nm} = 0$. Then, we adopt the elemental
scheme, in which the gauge and the Higgs bosons are regarded as elemental
fields. By these assumptions, all scalars do not have vevs at tree level. The
symmetry breaking mechanism will be implemented by the Coleman--Weinberg
mechanism.
  As a result, we show a possibility to solve the hierarchy problem in the
context of NCG. Unfortunately, the Coleman--Weinberg mechanism does not work in
the SM Higgs sector, because the Coleman--Weinberg effective potential becomes
unbounded from below for $m_{t} &gt; m_{Z}$. However, viable models can be
possible by proper extensions.
