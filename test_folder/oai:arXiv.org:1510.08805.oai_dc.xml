 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose simple and novel complex modulation techniques that
exploit the spatial domain to transmit complex-valued modulation symbols in
visible light wireless communication. The idea is to use multiple light
emitting diodes (LEDs) to convey the real and imaginary parts of a complex
modulation symbol and their sign information, or, alternately, to convey the
magnitude and phase of a complex symbol. The proposed techniques are termed as
{\em quad-LED complex modulation (QCM)} and {\em dual-LED complex modulation
(DCM)}. The proposed QCM scheme uses four LEDs (hence the name `quad-LED');
while the magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts are conveyed through
intensity modulation of LEDs, the sign information is conveyed through spatial
indexing of LEDs. The proposed DCM scheme, on the other hand, exploits the
polar representation of a complex symbol; it uses only two LEDs (hence the name
`dual-LED'), one LED to map the magnitude and another LED to map the phase of a
complex modulation symbol. These techniques do not need Hermitian symmetry
operation to generate LED compatible positive real transmit signals. We present
zero-forcing and minimum distance detectors and their performance for QCM-OFDM
and DCM-OFDM. We further propose another modulation scheme, termed as SM-DCM
{\em (spatial modulation-DCM)} scheme, which brings in the advantage of spatial
modulation (SM) to DCM. The proposed SM-DCM scheme uses two DCM BLOCKs with two
LEDs in each BLOCK, and an index bit decides which among the two BLOCKs will be
used in a given channel use. We study the bit error rate (BER) performance of
the proposed schemes through analysis and simulations. Using tight analytical
BER upper bounds and spatial distribution of the received signal-to-noise
ratios, we compute and plot the achievable rate contours for a given target BER
in QCM, DCM, and SM-DCM.
