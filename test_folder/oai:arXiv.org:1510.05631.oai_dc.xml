 <dc:description>  General genealogical processes such as $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents,
which respectively model multiple and simultaneous mergers, have important
applications in studying marine species, strong positive selection, recurrent
selective sweeps, strong bottlenecks, large sample sizes, and so on. Recently,
there has been significant progress in developing useful inference tools for
such general models. In particular, inference methods based on the site
frequency spectrum (SFS) have received noticeable attention. Here, we derive a
new formula for the expected SFS for general $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents,
which leads to an efficient algorithm. For time-homogeneous coalescents, the
runtime of our algorithm for computing the expected SFS is $O(n^2)$, where $n$
is the sample size. This is a factor of $n^2$ faster than the state-of-the-art
method. Furthermore, in contrast to existing methods, our method generalizes to
time-inhomogeneous $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents with measures that
factorize as $\Lambda(dx)/\zeta(t)$ and $\Xi(dx)/\zeta(t)$, respectively, where
$\zeta$ denotes a strictly positive function of time. The runtime of our
algorithm in this setting is $O(n^3)$. We also obtain general theoretical
results for the identifiability of the $\Lambda$ measure when $\zeta$ is a
constant function, as well as for the identifiability of the function $\zeta$
under a fixed $\Xi$ measure.
