 <dc:description>  Magneto-dielectric spectra of La0.95Ca0.05CoO3 covering the crossover of spin
states reveals strong coupling of its spin and dipolar degrees of freedom.
Signature of spin-state transition at 30K clearly manifests in magnetization,
supported by Co L_3,2-edge XAS data on the doped-specimen as consistent with
its suppressed T_SST vs. ~150K for pure LaCoO3. Dispersive activation-step
{\Delta}{\epsilon}'(T_{\omega})~O(10^2) and relaxation-peak
{\epsilon}"(T_{\omega}) reflect the allied influence of coexistent spin-states
on the dielectric character. Dipolar relaxation in the LS regime below T_SST is
partly segmental (VFT kinetics) featuring magnetic-field tunability, whereas in
the LS/IS-spin disordered state above 30K, it is uncorrelated (Arrhenic
kinetics) and almost impervious to the H-field. Kinetics-switchover defines the
dipolar-glass transition temperature Tg(H), below which the
magneto-thermally-activated cooperative relaxations freeze-out by the VFT
temperature T_0(H). Applied H-field facilitates thermally-activated SST and
accelerates the dipolar relaxations; a critical 5T field collapsing the entire
kinetics into a single Arrhenic behavior. Magneto-electricity (ME) spanning
sizable thermo-spectral range registers diverse signatures here in the kinetic,
spectral, and field behaviors, in contrast to the static/perturbative ME
observed close to the spin-ordering in typical multiferroics. Intrinsic
magneto-dielectricity (50%) along with vanishing magneto-loss is obtained at
(27K/50kHz)_9T. Sub-linear deviant field-hysteretic split seen in
{\epsilon}'(H)|_&gt;4T suggests the emergence of robust dipoles organized into
nano-clusters, realized by the internally-generated high magneto-electric
field. An elaborate {\omega}-T multi-dispersions diagram maps the rich variety
of phase/response patterns, revealing the highly-interacting magnetic and
electric moments in the system.
