 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the Wheeler-DeWitt equation modified by a
deformation of the second quantized canonical commutation relations. Such
modified commutation relations are induced by a Generalized Uncertainty
Principle. Since the Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be related to a
Sturm-Liouville problem where the associated eigenvalue can be interpreted as
the cosmological constant, it is possible to explicitly relate such an
eigenvalue to the deformation parameter of the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt
equation. The analysis is performed in a Mini-Superspace approach where the
scale factor appears as the only degree of freedom. The deformation of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation gives rise to a Cosmological Constant even in absence
of matter fields. As a Cosmological Constant cannot exists in absence of the
matter fields in the undeformed Mini-Superspace approach, so the existence of a
non-vanishing Cosmological Constant is a direct consequence of the deformation
by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle. In fact, we are able to demonstrate
that a non-vanishing Cosmological Constant exists even in the deformed flat
space. We also discuss the consequences of this deformation on the big bang
singularity.
