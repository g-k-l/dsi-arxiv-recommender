 <dc:description>  QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) is the class of problems which, though
potentially hard to solve, have a quantum solution which can be verified
efficiently using a quantum computer. It thus forms a natural quantum version
of the classical complexity class NP (and its probabilistic variant MA,
Merlin-Arthur games), where the verifier has only classical computational
resources. In this paper, we study what happens when we restrict the quantum
resources of the verifier to the bare minimum: individual measurements on
single qubits received as they come, one-by-one. We find that despite this
grave restriction, it is still possible to soundly verify any problem in QMA
for the verifier with the minimum quantum resources possible, without using any
quantum memory or multiqubit operations. We provide two independent proofs of
this fact, based on measurement based quantum computation and the local
Hamiltonian problem, respectively. The former construction also applies to
QMA$_1$, i.e., QMA with one-sided error.
