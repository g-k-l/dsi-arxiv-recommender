 <dc:description>  Fast outflows of gas, driven by the interaction between the radio-jets and
ISM of the host galaxy, are being observed in an increasing number of galaxies.
One such example is the nearby radio galaxy 3C293. In this paper we present
Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations taken with OASIS on the William Herschel
Telescope (WHT), enabling us to map the spatial extent of the ionised gas
outflows across the central regions of the galaxy. The jet-driven outflow in
3C293 is detected along the inner radio lobes with a mass outflow rate ranging
from $\sim 0.05-0.17$ solar masses/yr (in ionised gas) and corresponding
kinetic power of $\sim 0.5-3.5\times 10^{40}$ erg/s. Investigating the
kinematics of the gas surrounding the radio jets (i.e. not directly associated
with the outflow), we find line-widths broader than $300$ km/s up to 5 kpc in
the radial direction from the nucleus (corresponding to 3.5 kpc in the
direction perpendicular to the radio axis at maximum extent). Along the axis of
the radio jet line-widths $&gt;400$ km/s are detected out to 7 kpc from the
nucleus and line-widths of $&gt;500$ km/s at a distance of 12 kpc from the
nucleus, indicating that the disturbed kinematics clearly extend well beyond
the high surface brightness radio structures of the jets. This is suggestive of
the cocoon structure seen in simulations of jet-ISM interaction and implies
that the radio jets are capable of disturbing the gas throughout the central
regions of the host galaxy in all directions.
