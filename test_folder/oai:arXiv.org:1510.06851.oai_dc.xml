 <dc:description>  We briefly review the super-natural supersymmetry (SUSY), which provides a
most promising solution to the SUSY electroweak fine-tuning problem. In
particular, we address its subtle issues as well. Unlike the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard model (MSSM), the Next to MSSM (NMSSM) can be scale
invariant and has no mass parameter in its Lagrangian before SUSY and gauge
symmetry breakings. Therefore, the NMSSM is a perfect framework for
super-natural SUSY. To give the SUSY breaking soft mass to the singlet, we
consider the moduli and dilaton dominant SUSY breaking scenarios in M-theory on
$S^1/Z_2$. In these scenarios, SUSY is broken by one and only one $F$-term of
moduli or dilaton, and the SUSY breaking soft terms can be determined via the
K\"ahler potential and superpotential from Calabi-Yau compactification of
M-theory on $S^1/Z_2$. Thus, as predicted by super-natural SUSY, the SUSY
electroweak fine-tuning measure is of unity order. In the moduli dominant SUSY
breaking scenario, the right-handed sleptons are relatively light around 1 TeV,
stau can be even as light as 580 GeV and degenerate with the lightest
neutralino, chargino masses are larger than 1 TeV, the light stop masses are
around 2 TeV or larger, the first two-generation squark masses are about 3 TeV
or larger, and gluinos are heavier than squarks. In the dilaton dominant SUSY
breaking scenario, the qualitative picture remain the same but we have heavier
spectra as compared to moduli dominant SUSY breaking scenario. In addition to
it, we have Higgs $H_{2}/A_{1}$-resonance solutions for dark matter (DM). In
both scenarios, the minimal value of DM relic density is about 0.2. To obtain
the observed DM relic density, we can consider the dilution effect from
supercritical string cosmology or introduce the axino as the lightest
supersymmetric particle.
