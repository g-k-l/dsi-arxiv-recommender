 <dc:description>  Correlations of galaxy ellipticities with large-scale structure, due to
galactic tidal interactions, provide a potentially significant contaminant to
measurements of cosmic shear. However, these intrinsic alignments are still
poorly understood for galaxies at the redshifts typically used in cosmic shear
analyses. For spiral galaxies, it is thought that tidal torquing is significant
in determining alignments resulting in zero correlation between the intrinsic
ellipticity and the gravitational potential in linear theory. Here, we
calculate the leading-order correction to this result in the tidal-torque model
from non-linear evolution, using second-order perturbation theory, and relate
this to the contamination from intrinsic alignments to the recently-measured
cross-correlation between galaxy ellipticities and the CMB lensing potential.
On the scales relevant for CMB lensing observations, the squeezed limit of the
gravitational bispectrum dominates the correlation. Physically, the large-scale
mode that sources CMB lensing modulates the small-scale power and hence the
intrinsic ellipticity, due to non-linear evolution. We find that the angular
cross-correlation from tidal torquing has a very similar scale dependence as in
the linear alignment model, believed to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies.
The amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted to depend strongly on the
formation redshift, being smaller for galaxies that formed at higher redshift
when the bispectrum of the gravitational potential was smaller. Finally, we
make simple forecasts for constraints on intrinsic alignments from the
correlation of forthcoming cosmic shear measurements with current CMB lensing
measurements. We note that cosmic variance can be significantly reduced in
measurements of the difference in the intrinsic alignments for elliptical and
spiral galaxies if these can be separated (e.g., using colour).
