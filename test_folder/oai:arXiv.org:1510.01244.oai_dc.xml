 <dc:description>  The IceCube telescope has detected diffuse neutrino emission, 20 events of
which were reported to be above 60~TeV. In this paper, we fit the diffuse
neutrino spectrum using Poisson statistics, which are the most appropriate for
the low counts per energy bin. We extend the fitted energy range and exploit
the fact that no neutrinos were detected above 2~PeV, despite the high detector
sensitivity around the Glashow resonance at 6.3\,PeV and beyond. A best-fit
power-law slope of $\alpha=2.9\pm 0.3$ is found with no evidence for a
high-energy cutoff. This slope is steeper than $\alpha=2.3\pm 0.3$ found by the
IceCube team using a different fitting method. Such a steep spectrum
facilitates the identification of high energy ($\gg$ PeV) neutrinos, if
detected, to be due to the GZK effect of cosmic-ray protons interacting with
the Extragalactic Background Light. We use the ratio of EeV to PeV neutrinos in
GZK models to show that the currently detected PeV neutrinos could not be due
to the GZK effect, because this would imply many more higher-energy neutrinos
that should have been detected, but were not. The non-detection of GZK
neutrinos by IceCube despite more than essentially 1200 observing days, has
already ruled out (at 95\% confidence) models that predict rates of $\sim1$
neutrino/yr or more. We use this non-detection to quantify the confidence at
which GZK models are ruled out, and compute the additional IceCube and (in the
future) ARA observing time that would rule them out with 95\% confidence if no
detection is made.
