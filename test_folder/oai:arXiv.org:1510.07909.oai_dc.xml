 <dc:description>  A systematic investigation of even-even superheavy elements in the region of
proton numbers $100 \leq Z \leq 130$ and in the region of neutron numbers from
the proton-drip line up to neutron number $N=196$ is presented. For this study
we use five most up-to-date covariant energy density functionals of different
types, with a non-linear meson coupling, with density dependent meson
couplings, and with density-dependent zero-range interactions. Pairing
correlations are treated within relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) theory
based on an effective separable particle-particle interaction of finite range
and deformation effects are taken into account. This allows us to assess the
spread of theoretical predictions within the present covariant models for the
binding energies, deformation parameters, shell structures and $\alpha$-decay
half-lives. Contrary to the previous studies in covariant density functional
theory, it was found that the impact of $N=172$ spherical shell gap on the
structure of superheavy elements is very limited. Similar to non-relativistic
functionals some covariant functionals predict the important role played by the
spherical $N=184$ gap. For these functionals (NL3*, DD-ME2 and PC-PK1), there
is a band of spherical nuclei along and near the $Z=120$ and $N=184$ lines.
However, for other functionals (DD-PC1 and DD-ME$\delta$) oblate shapes
dominate at and in the vicinity of these lines. Available experimental data are
in general described with comparable accuracy and do not allow to discriminate
these predictions.
