 <dc:description>  Feedback is an essential composition operator in many classes of reactive and
other systems. This paper studies feedback in the context of compositional
theories with refinement. Such theories allow to reason about systems on a
component-by-component basis, and to characterize substitutability as a
refinement relation. Although compositional theories of feedback do exist, they
are limited either to deterministic systems (functions) or input-receptive
systems (total relations). In this work we propose a compositional theory of
feedback which applies to non-deterministic and non-input-receptive systems
(e.g., partial relations). To achieve this, we use the semantic frameworks of
predicate and property transformers, and relations with fail and unknown
values. We show how to define instantaneous feedback for stateless systems and
feedback with unit delay for stateful systems. Both operations preserve the
refinement relation, and both can be applied to non-deterministic and
non-input-receptive systems.
