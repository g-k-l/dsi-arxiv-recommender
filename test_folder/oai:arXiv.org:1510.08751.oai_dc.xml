 <dc:description>  In this work we study the Hubbard model on a bi-partite lattice using the
coupled-cluster method (CCM). We first investigate what, within this approach,
allows us to reproduce the zero order parameter in the 1D model, as predicted
by the exact solution. We show that we need a critical correlation in some of
the coupled-cluster model coefficients to reproduce this result, as can be
obtained by applying some very accurate results using the CCM for the
Heisenberg model. Using the same approach we then tackle the 2D Hubbard model
on a square and a honeycomb lattice, both of which can be thought to represent
2D materials. We also analyse the charge and spin excitations, with reasonable
results.
