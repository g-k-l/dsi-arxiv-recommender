 <dc:description>  We present basic atmospheric parameters ($T_{eff}$, $log g$, $v_{t}$ and
[Fe/H]), rotation velocities and absolute radial velocities as well as
luminosities, masses, ages and radii for 402 stars (including 11 single-lined
spectroscopic binaries), mostly subgiants and giants. For 272 of them we
present parameters for the first time. For another 53 stars we present
estimates of $T_{eff}$ and $log g$ based on photometric calibrations. More than
half objects were found to be subgiants, there is also a large group of giants
and a few stars appeard to be dwarfs. The results show that the presented
sample is composed of stars with masses ranging from 0.52 to $3.21 M_{\odot}$
of which 17 have masses $\geq$ $2.0 M_{\odot}$. The radii of stars studied in
this paper range from 0.66 to $36.04 R_{\odot}$ with vast majority having radii
between 2.0 and $4.0 R_{\odot}$. They are generally less metal abundant than
the Sun with median [Fe/H]$=-0.07$. For 62 stars in common with other planet
searches we found a very good agreement in obtained stellar atmospheric
parameters. We also present basic properties of the complete list of 744 stars
that form the PTPS evolved stars sample. We examined stellar masses for 1255
stars in five other planet searches and found some of them likely to be
significantly overestimated. Applying our uniformly determined stellar masses
we confirm the apparent increase of companions masses for evolved stars, and we
explain it, as well as lack of close-in planets with limited effective radial
velocity precision for those stars due to activity.
