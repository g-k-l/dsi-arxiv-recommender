 <dc:description>  We propose a setup based on two coupled quantum dots where thermodynamics of
a measurement can be quantitatively characterized. The information obtained in
the measurement can be utilized by performing feedback in a manner apparently
breaking the second law of thermodynamics. In this way the setup can be
operated as a Maxwell's Demon where both the measurement and feedback are
performed separately by controlling an external parameter. This is analogous to
the case of the original Szilard engine. Since the setup contains both the
microscopic demon and the engine itself, the operation of the whole
measurement-feedback cycle can be explained in detail at the level of single
realizations. In addition, we derive integral fluctuation relations for both
the bare and coarse-grained entropy productions in the setup.
