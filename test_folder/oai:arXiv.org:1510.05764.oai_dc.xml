 <dc:description>  An electron irradiated by a linearly polarized relativistic intensity laser
pulse in a cylindrical plasma channel can gain significant energy from the
pulse. The laser electric and magnetic fields drive electron oscillations in a
plane making it natural to expect the electron trajectory to be flat. We show
that strong modulations of the relativistic $\gamma$-factor associated with the
energy enhancement cause the free oscillations perpendicular to the plane of
the driven motion to become unstable. As a consequence, out of plane
displacements grow to become comparable to the amplitude of the driven
oscillations and the electron trajectory becomes essentially three-dimensional,
even if at an early stage of the acceleration it was flat. The development of
the instability profoundly affects the x-ray emission, causing considerable
divergence of the radiation perpendicular to the plane of the driven
oscillations, while also reducing the overall emitted energy.
