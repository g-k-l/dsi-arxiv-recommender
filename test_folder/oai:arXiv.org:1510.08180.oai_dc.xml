 <dc:description>  Complex morphologies and microstructures that emerge during materials growth
and solidification are often determined by both equilibrium and kinetic
properties of the interface and their crystalline anisotropies. However limited
knowledge is available for the alloying and particularly the compositionally
generated elastic effects on these interface characteristics. Here we
systematically investigate such compositional effects on the interfacial
properties of an alloy model system based on the phase-field-crystal analysis,
including the solid-liquid interfacial free energy, kinetic coefficient, and
lattice pinning strength. Scaling relations for these interfacial quantities
over various ranges of material parameters are identified and predicted. Our
results indicate the important effects of couplings among mesoscopic and
microscopic length scales of alloy structure and concentration, and also the
influence of compressive and tensile interface stresses induced by composition
variations. The approach developed here provides an efficient way to
systematically identify these key material properties beyond the traditional
atomistic and continuum methods.
