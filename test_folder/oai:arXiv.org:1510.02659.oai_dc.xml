 <dc:description>  Given a planar graph $G(V,E)$ and a partition of the neighbors of each vertex
$v \in V$ in four sets $UR(v)$, $UL(v)$, $DL(v)$, and $DR(v)$, the problem
Windrose Planarity asks to decide whether $G$ admits a windrose-planar drawing,
that is, a planar drawing in which (i) each neighbor $u \in UR(v)$ is above and
to the right of $v$, (ii) each neighbor $u \in UL(v)$ is above and to the left
of $v$, (iii) each neighbor $u \in DL(v)$ is below and to the left of $v$, (iv)
each neighbor $u \in DR(v)$ is below and to the right of $v$, and (v) edges are
represented by curves that are monotone with respect to each axis. By
exploiting both the horizontal and the vertical relationship among vertices,
windrose-planar drawings allow to simultaneously visualize two partial orders
defined by means of the edges of the graph.
  Although the problem is NP-hard in the general case, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm for testing whether there exists a windrose-planar
drawing that respects a combinatorial embedding that is given as part of the
input. This algorithm is based on a characterization of the plane
triangulations admitting a windrose-planar drawing. Furthermore, for any
embedded graph admitting a windrose-planar drawing we show how to construct one
with at most one bend per edge on an $O(n) \times O(n)$ grid. The latter result
contrasts with the fact that straight-line windrose-planar drawings may require
exponential area.
