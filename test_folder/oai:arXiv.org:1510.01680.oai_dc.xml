 <dc:description>  We study experimentally and computationally the dynamics of granular flow
during impacts, where intruders strike a collection of disks from above. In the
regime where granular force dynamics are much more rapid than the intruder
motion, we find that the particle flow near the intruder is proportional to the
instantaneous intruder speed; it is essentially constant when normalized by
that speed. The granular flow is nearly divergence-free and remains in balance
with the intruder, despite the latter's rapid deceleration. Simulations
indicate that this observation is insensitive to grain properties, which can be
explained by the separation of time scales between intergrain force dynamics
and intruder dynamics. Assuming there is a comparable separation of time
scales, we expect our results are applicable to a broad class of dynamic or
transient granular flows. Our results suggest that descriptions of
static-in-time granular flows might be extended or modified to describe these
dynamic flows. Additionally, we find that accurate grain-grain interactions are
not necessary to correctly capture the granular flow in this regime.
