 <dc:description>  We introduce a simple network formation model for social networks. Agents are
nodes, connecting to another agent by building a directed edge (or accepting a
connection from another agent) has a cost, and reaching (or being reached by)
other agents via short directed paths has a benefit; in effect, an agent wants
to reach others quickly, but without the cost of directly connecting each and
every one. We prove that asynchronous edge dynamics always converge to a stable
network; in fact, for nontrivial ranges of parameters this convergence is fast.
Moreover, the set of fixed points of the dynamics form a nontrivial class of
networks. For the static game, we give classes of efficient networks for
nontrivial parameter ranges and further study their stability. We close several
problems, and leave many interesting ones open.
