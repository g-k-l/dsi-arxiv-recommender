 <dc:description>  An accurate and extensive Inter-laboratory comparison between the laboratory
for the calibration of multifunction electrical instruments of the National
Institute of Metrology Research (INRIM) and a secondary high level electrical
calibration laboratory was performed with satisfactory results. The instrument
involved in the comparison was a top class multifunction calibrator, chosen for
its wide measurement fields and its excellent definability requiring
sensitively small uncertainties to calibrate it. The relevancy of this work is
that for the first time at INRIM, a ILC involving a grid of about one hundred
and thirty measurement points was carried out. This ILC allowed to exhaustively
check the measurement capabilities and exploit the measurement techniques of
the secondary laboratory. Attention was also paid to individuate the correlated
uncertainty components between the two laboratories measurements. The
calibrator resulted adequate to verify the capabilities of high level secondary
electrical calibration laboratories, better
