 <dc:description>  Algebraic connectivity, the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, is a
measure of node and link connectivity on networks. When studying interconnected
networks it is useful to consider a multiplex model, where the component
networks operate together with inter-layer links among them. In order to have a
well-connected multilayer structure, it is necessary to optimally design these
inter-layer links considering realistic constraints. In this work, we solve the
problem of finding an optimal weight distribution for one-to-one inter-layer
links under budget constraint. We show that for the special multiplex
configurations with identical layers, the uniform weight distribution is always
optimal. On the other hand, when the two layers are arbitrary, increasing the
budget reveals the existence of two different regimes. Up to a certain
threshold budget, the second eigenvalue of the supra-Laplacian is simple, the
optimal weight distribution is uniform, and the Fiedler vector is constant on
each layer. Increasing the budget past the threshold, the optimal weight
distribution can be non-uniform. The interesting consequence of this result is
that there is no need to solve the optimization problem when the available
budget is less than the threshold, which can be easily found analytically.
