 <dc:description>  We use new equations for the interstitial impurity diffusion fluxes under
strain to study impurity atom redistribution in the vicinity of dislocations.
Two levels of simulation are applied. The first one is evaluation of
coefficients that determine the influence of strain tensor components on
interstitial diffusion fluxes in FCC structures. For this purpose we have
developed a model into the framework of a molecular static method taking into
account an atom environment both near the interstitial site and for the
saddle-point configuration. The second level is modeling the interstitial
segregation formation based on nonlinear diffusion equations that take strains
generated by defects into account. The results show that the distributions of
the interstitials near the dislocations have quite complicated characters and
the vacancy distribution has a qualitatively different character as compared
with the carbon distribution.
