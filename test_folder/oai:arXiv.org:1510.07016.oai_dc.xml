 <dc:description>  We present and test chemical models for three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations of galaxies. We explore the effect of changing key parameters such
as metallicity, radiation and non-equilibrium versus equilibrium metal cooling
approximations on the transition between the gas phases in the interstellar
medium. The microphysics is modelled by employing the public chemistry package
KROME and the chemical networks have been tested to work in a wide range of
densities and temperatures. We describe a simple H/He network following the
formation of H$_2$, and a more sophisticated network which includes metals.
Photochemistry, thermal processes, and different prescriptions for the H$_2$
catalysis on dust are presented and tested within a one-zone framework. The
resulting network is made publicly available on the KROME webpage. We find that
employing an accurate treatment of the dust-related processes induces a faster
HI--H$_2$ transition. In addition, we show when the equilibrium assumption for
metal cooling holds, and how a non-equilibrium approach affects the thermal
evolution of the gas and the HII--HI transition. These models can be employed
in any hydrodynamical code via an interface to KROME and can be applied to
different problems including isolated galaxies, cosmological simulations of
galaxy formation and evolution, supernova explosions in molecular clouds, and
the modelling of star-forming regions. The metal network can be used for a
comparison with observational data of CII 158 $\mu$m emission both for
high-redshift as well as for local galaxies.
