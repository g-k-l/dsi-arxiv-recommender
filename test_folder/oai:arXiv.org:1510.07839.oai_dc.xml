 <dc:description>  After the presence of high Bandwidth-Delay Product (high-BDP) networks, many
researches have been conducted to prove either the existing TCP variants can
achieve an excellent performance without wasting the bandwidth of these
networks or not. In this paper, a comparative test-bed experiment on a set of
high speed TCP variants has been conducted to show their differences in
bandwidth utilization, loss ratio and TCP-Fairness. The involved TCP Variants
in this experiment are: NewReno, STCP, HS-TCP, H-TCP and CUBIC. These TCP
variants have been examined in both cases of single and parallel schemes. The
core of this work is how to evaluate these TCP variants over a single
bottleneck network using a new parallel scheme to fully utilize the bandwidth
of this network, and to show the impact of accelerating these variants on
bandwidth utilization, loss-ratio and fairness. The results of this work reveal
that, first: the proposed parallel scheme strongly outperforms the single based
TCP in terms of bandwidth utilization and fairness. Second: CUBIC achieved
better performance than NewReno, STCP, H-TCP and HS-TCP in both cases of single
and parallel schemes. Briefly, parallel TCP scheme increases the utilization of
network resources, and it is relatively good in fairness.
