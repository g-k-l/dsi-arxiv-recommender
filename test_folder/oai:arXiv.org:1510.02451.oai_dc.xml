 <dc:description>  Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become standard tools in statistics to
sample from complex probability measures. Many available techniques rely on
discrete-time reversible Markov chains whose transition kernels build up over
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We explore and propose several original
extensions of an alternative approach introduced recently in Peters and de With
(2012) where the target distribution of interest is explored using a
continuous-time Markov process. In the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a trial
move to a region of lower target density, equivalently "higher energy", than
the current state can be rejected with positive probability. In this
alternative approach, a particle moves along straight lines continuously around
the space and, when facing a high energy barrier, it is not rejected but its
path is modified by bouncing against this barrier. The resulting non-reversible
Markov process provides a rejection-free MCMC sampling scheme. We propose
several original techniques to simulate this continuous-time process exactly in
a wide range of scenarios of interest to statisticians. When the target
distribution factorizes as a product of factors involving only subsets of
variables, such as the posterior distribution associated to a probabilistic
graphical model, it is possible to modify the original algorithm to exploit
this structure and update in parallel variables within each clique. We present
several extensions by proposing methods to sample mixed discrete-continuous
distributions and distributions restricted to a connected smooth domain. We
also show that it is possible to move the particle using a general flow instead
of straight lines. We demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology through
simulations on a variety of applications and show that it can outperform Hybrid
Monte Carlo schemes in interesting scenarios.
