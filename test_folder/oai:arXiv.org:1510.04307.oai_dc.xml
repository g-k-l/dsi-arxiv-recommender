 <dc:description>  We present multi-sightline absorption spectroscopy of cool gas around three
lensing galaxies at z=0.4-0.7. These lenses have half-light radii r_e=2.6-8 kpc
and stellar masses of log M*/Ms=10.9-11.4, and therefore resemble nearby
passive elliptical galaxies. The lensed QSO sightlines presented here occur at
projected distances of d=3-15 kpc (or d~1-2 r_e) from the lensing galaxies,
providing for the first time an opportunity to probe both interstellar gas at
r~r_e and circumgalactic gas at larger radii r&gt;&gt;re of these distant quiescent
galaxies. We observe distinct gas absorption properties among different lenses
and among sightlines of individual lenses. Specifically, while the quadruple
lens for HE0435-1223 shows no absorption features to very sensitive limits
along all four sightlines, strong Mg II, Fe II, Mg I, and Ca II absorption
transitions are detected along both sightlines near the double lens for
HE0047-1756, and in one of the two sightlines near the double lens for
HE1104-1805. The absorbers are resolved into 8-15 individual components with a
line-of-sight velocity spread of dv~300-600 km/s. The large ionic column
densities, log N&gt;14, observed in two components suggest that these may be Lyman
limit or damped Lya absorbers with a significant neutral hydrogen fraction. The
majority of the absorbing components exhibit a uniform super solar Fe/Mg ratio
with a scatter of &lt;0.1 dex across the full dv range. Given a predominantly old
stellar population in these lensing galaxies, we argue that the observed large
velocity width and Fe-rich abundance pattern can be explained by SNe Ia
enriched gas at radius r~r_e. We show that additional spatial constraints in
line-of-sight velocity and relative abundance ratios afforded by a
multi-sightline approach provide a powerful tool to resolve the origin of
chemically-enriched cool gas in massive halos.
