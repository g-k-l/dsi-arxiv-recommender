 <dc:description>  Molecular Communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method based on
the exchange of molecules for information transfer among nanoscale devices. MC
has been extensively studied from various aspects in the literature; however,
the physical design of MC transceiving units is largely neglected with the
assumption that network nodes are entirely biological devices, e.g., engineered
bacteria, which are intrinsically capable of receiving and transmitting
molecular messages. However, the low information processing capacity of
biological devices and the challenge to interface them with macroscale networks
hinder the true application potential of nanonetworks. To overcome this
problem, recently, we proposed a nanobioelectronic MC receiver architecture
exploiting the nanoscale field effect transistor-based biosensor (bioFET)
technology, which provides noninvasive and sensitive molecular detection while
producing electrical signals as the output. In this paper, we introduce a
comprehensive model for silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based MC receivers by
integrating the underlying processes in MC and bioFET to provide a unified
analysis framework. We derive closed-form expressions for noise statistics,
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver output, and symbol error
probability (SEP). Performance evaluation in terms of SNR and SEP reveals the
effects of individual system parameters on the detection performance of the
proposed MC receiver.
