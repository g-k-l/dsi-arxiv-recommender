 <dc:description>  We study unitary conformal field theories with a unique stress tensor and at
least one higher-spin conserved current in d&gt;3 dimensions. We prove that every
such theory contains an infinite number of higher-spin conserved currents of
arbitrarily high spin, and that Ward identities generated by the conserved
charges of these currents imply that the correlators of the stress tensor and
the conserved currents of the theory must coincide with one of the following
three possibilities: a) a theory of n free bosons (for some integer n), b) a
theory of n free fermions, or c) a theory of n (d-2)/2-forms. For d even, all
three structures exist, but for d odd, it may be the case that the third
structure (c) does not; if it does exist, it is unclear what theory, if any,
realizes it. This is a generalization of the result proved in three dimensions
by Maldacena and Zhiboedov [arXiv:1112.1016]. This paper supersedes the
previous paper by the authors [arXiv:1307.8092]
