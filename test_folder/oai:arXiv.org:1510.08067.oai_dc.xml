 <dc:description>  We investigate correlations between different physical properties of
star-forming galaxies in the "Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their
Environments" (EAGLE) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suite over the
redshift range $0\le z\le 4.5$. A principal component analysis reveals that
neutral gas fraction ($f_{\rm gas, neutral}$), stellar mass ($M_{\rm stellar}$)
and star formation rate (SFR) account for most of the variance seen in the
population, with galaxies tracing a two-dimensional, nearly flat, surface in
the three-dimensional space of $f_{\rm gas, neutral}-M_{\rm stellar}-\rm SFR$
with little scatter. The location of this plane varies little with redshift,
whereas galaxies themselves move along the plane as their $f_{\rm gas,
neutral}$ and SFR drop with redshift. The positions of galaxies along the plane
are highly correlated with gas metallicity. The metallicity can therefore be
robustly predicted from $f_{\rm gas, neutral}$, or from the $M_{\rm stellar}$
and SFR. We argue that the appearance of this "fundamental plane of star
formation" is a consequence of self-regulation, with the plane's curvature set
by the dependence of the SFR on gas density and metallicity. We analyse a large
compilation of observations spanning the redshift range $0\lesssim \rm
z\lesssim 2.5$, and find that such a plane is also present in the data. The
properties of the observed fundamental plane of star formation are in good
agreement with EAGLE's predictions.

  publication in MNRAS. Changes from previous version are mainly in the way PCA
  was performed, but this had no impact in our conclusions. For movies and
