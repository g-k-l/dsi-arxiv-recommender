 <dc:description>  In 1880, Stokes famously demonstrated that the singularity that occurs at the
crest of the steepest possible water wave in infinite depth must correspond to
a corner of $120^\circ$. Here, the complex velocity scales like $f^{1/3}$ where
$f$ is the complex potential. Later in 1973, Grant showed that for any wave
away from the steepest configuration, the singularity $f = f^*$ moves into the
complex plane, and is of order $(f-f^*)^{1/2}$ (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 59, 1973,
pp. 257-262). Grant conjectured that as the highest wave is approached, other
singularities must coalesce at the crest so as to cancel the square-root
behaviour. Despite recent advances, the complete singularity structure of the
Stokes wave is still not well understood. In this work, we develop numerical
methods for constructing the Riemann surface that represents the extension of
the water wave into the complex plane. We show that a countably infinite number
of distinct singularities exists on other branches of the solution, and that
these singularities coalesce as Stokes' highest wave is approached.
