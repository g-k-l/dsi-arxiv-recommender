 <dc:description>  We give conditions ensuring that the Julia set and the escaping set of an
entire function of completely regular growth have positive Lebesgue measure.
The essential hypotheses are that the indicator is positive except perhaps at
isolated points and that most zeros are located in neighborhoods of finitely
many rays. We apply the result to solutions of linear differential equations.
