 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a smart idea to couple importance sampling and
Multilevel Monte Carlo. We advocate a per level approach with as many
importance sampling parameters as the number of levels, which enables us to
compute the different levels independently. The search for parameters is
carried out using sample average approximation, which basically consists in
applying deterministic optimisation techniques to Monte Carlo approximation
rather than resorting to stochastic approximation. Our innovative estimator
leads to a robust and efficient procedure reducing both the bias and the
variance for a given computational effort. In the setting of discretized
diffusions, we prove that our estimator satisfies a strong law of large numbers
and a central limit theorem with optimal limiting variance. Finally, we
illustrate the efficiency of our method on several numerical challenges coming
from quantitative finance.
