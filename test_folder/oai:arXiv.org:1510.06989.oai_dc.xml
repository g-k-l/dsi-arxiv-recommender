 <dc:description>  Identifying the parameters of a model and rating competitive models based on
measured data has been among the most important but challenging topics in
modern science and engineering, with great potential of application in
structural system identification, updating and development of high fidelity
models. These problems in principle can be tackled using a Bayesian
probabilistic approach, where the parameters to be identified are treated as
uncertain and their inference information are given in terms of their posterior
(i.e., given data) probability distribution. For complex models encountered in
applications, efficient computational tools robust to the number of uncertain
parameters in the problem are required for computing the posterior statistics,
which can generally be formulated as a multi-dimensional integral over the
space of the uncertain parameters. Subset Simulation (SuS) has been developed
for solving reliability problems involving complex systems and it is found to
be robust to the number of uncertain parameters. An analogy has been recently
established between a Bayesian updating problem and a reliability problem,
which opens up the possibility of efficient solution by SuS. The formulation,
called BUS (Bayesian Updating with Structural reliability methods), is based on
conventional rejection principle. Its theoretical correctness and efficiency
requires the prudent choice of a multiplier, which has remained an open
question. Motivated by the choice of the multiplier and its philosophical role,
this paper presents a study of BUS. The work leads to a revised formulation
that resolves the issues regarding the multiplier so that SuS can be
implemented without knowing the multiplier. Examples are presented to
illustrate the theory and applications.
