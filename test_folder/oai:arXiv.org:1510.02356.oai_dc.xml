 <dc:description>  Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using
data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent--due to events
such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer--it can be
misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions
have taken a mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes.
Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies
might arise. Such "process-agnostic" approaches typically infer a tree for each
locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree
distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context
of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model
selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable
number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is
poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of
phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common
evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are
distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or
Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal
number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette
criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the
approach by (i) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast
species and (ii) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced
loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta. We release treeCl, a new
program to cluster genes of common evolutionary history (http://git.io/treeCl).
