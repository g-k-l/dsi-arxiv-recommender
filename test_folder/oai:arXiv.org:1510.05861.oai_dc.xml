 <dc:description>  Stochastic density functional theory is applied to analyze the conductivity
of strong two species electrolytes at arbitrary field strengths. The
corresponding stochastic equations for the density of the electrolyte species
are solved by linearizing them about the mean density of ionic species,
yielding an effective Gaussian theory. The non-equilibrium density-density
correlation functions are computed and the conductivity of the electrolyte is
deduced. In the bulk, our results give a simple derivation of the results of
Onsager and coworkers who used very different methods. The method developed
here can also be used to study electrolytes confined in one and two dimensions
and interacting via either the three dimensional Coulomb interaction or the
Coulomb interaction corresponding to that dimension of space.
