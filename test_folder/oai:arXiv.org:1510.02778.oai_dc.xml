 <dc:description>  Erwin Schrodinger famously and presciently ascribed the vehicle transmitting
the hereditary information underlying life to an `aperiodic crystal'. We
compare and contrast this, only later discovered to be stored in the linear
biomolecule DNA, with the information bearing, layered quasi-one-dimensional
materials investigated by the emerging field of chaotic crystallography.
Despite differences in functionality, the same information measures capture
structure and novelty in both, suggesting an intimate coherence between the
information character of biotic and abiotic matter---a broadly applicable
physics of information. We review layered solids and consider three examples of
how information- and computation-theoretic techniques are being applied to
understand their structure. In particular, (i) we review recent efforts to
apply new kinds of information measures to quantify disordered crystals; (ii)
we discuss the structure of ice I in information-theoretic terms; and (iii) we
recount recent experimental results on tris(bicyclo[2.1.1]hexeno)benzene TBHB),
showing how an information-theoretic analysis yields additional insight into
its structure. We then illustrate a new Second Law of Thermodynamics that
describes information processing in active low-dimensional materials, reviewing
Maxwell's Demon and a new class of molecular devices that act as information
catalysts. Lastly, we conclude by speculating on how these ideas from
informational materials science may impact biology.
