 <dc:description>  A large (240 cm $\times$ 120 cm $\times$ 0.2 cm) oil-free High Pressure
Laminate (HPL), commonly referred as "bakelite", Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC)
has been developed at VECC-Kolkata using locally available P-302 OLTC grade
HPL. The chamber has been operated in streamer mode using Argon, Freon(R134a)
and Iso-butane in a ratio of 34:57:9 by volume. The electrodes and glue samples
have been characterised by measuring their electrical parameters like bulk
resistivity and surface resistivity. The performance of the chamber has been
studied by measuring the efficiency, its uniformity and stability in detection
of cosmic muons. Timing measurement has been performed at a central location of
the chamber. The chamber showed an efficiency $&gt;$95$\%$ and time resolution
($\sigma$), at the point of measurement, $\sim$0.83 ns at 9000V. Details of the
material characterisation, fabrication procedure and performance studies have
been discussed.
