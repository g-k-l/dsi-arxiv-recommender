 <dc:description>  We propose a minimal vector-like leptonic dark matter (DM) with
renormalisable interaction in a beyond the Standard Model (SM) scenario, where
the SM is augmented with a vector-like doublet and a singlet leptons. The
additional fermions are odd under a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry, while the rest of
the SM particles are singlets, and thus providing stability to the DM. In this
scenario, we show that, the DM emerges as an admixture of the neutral component
of the vector-like doublet and the singlet leptons. The singlet-doublet mixing
($\sin \theta$) plays a crucial role in yielding the correct relic density as
well as in obtaining null direct DM search results through an interplay of
interactions via $Z$ and Higgs mediation. The mixing is also strongly
constrained from the invisible Z and Higgs decay width. We found that the
correct relic abundance of DM can be obtained in a large region of parameter
space for DM-mass larger than $ M_Z/2$ and $\sin \theta \le 0.1$. The details
of model phenomenology with collider signatures at the Large hadron Collider
(LHC) are discussed. In particular, we show that for $\sin \theta \le 0.01$,
the charged companion of the DM can give rise to an observable displaced vertex
signature, marking a significant departure from other fermionic DM scenarios,
while keeping the relic abundance intact.

 <dc:description>Comment: 22 pages, 19 figures, 5 tables; the manuscript has undergone a
  significant modification in parameter space scan plots, for example a summary
  of constraints have been added in one figure and accordingly discussions
  added and altered in the text; singlet-doublet mixing and its importance is
  highlighted. Current version is accepted in PRD</dc:description>
