 <dc:description>  The hypothesis that living systems can benefit from operating at the vicinity
of critical points has gained momentum in recent years. Criticality may confer
an optimal balance between exceedingly ordered and too noisy states. We here
present a model, based on information theory and statistical mechanics,
illustrating how and why a community of agents aimed at understanding and
communicating with each other converges to a globally coherent state in which
all individuals are close to an internal critical state, i.e. at the borderline
between order and disorder. We study --both analytically and computationally--
the circumstances under which criticality is the best possible outcome of the
dynamical process, confirming the convergence to critical points under very
generic conditions. Finally, we analyze the effect of cooperation (agents try
to enhance not only their fitness, but also that of other individuals) and
competition (agents try to improve their own fitness and to diminish those of
competitors) within our setting. The conclusion is that, while competition
fosters criticality, cooperation hinders it and can lead to more ordered or
more disordered consensual solutions.
