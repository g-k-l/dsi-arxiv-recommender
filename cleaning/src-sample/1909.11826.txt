Abstract

The truncation errors in equations of state (EOSs) of nuclear matter derived from the chiral

nucleon-nucleon (N N ) potentials at diﬀerent expansion orders are analyzed by a Bayesian model.

These EOSs are expanded as functions of a dimensionless parameter, Q, which is determined by

Fermi momentum, kF and breakdown scale, Λb. The degree-of-belief (DoB) intervals predicted by

the chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory are calculated within the corresponding expansion coeﬃcients and

the speciﬁc prior probability distribution functions in terms of Bayes theorem. The truncation

errors of EOSs, generated by the DoB intervals, exhibit good order-by-order convergences with

diﬀerent chiral expansion order potentials. When DoB is considered as 1σ credibility, i.e., 68.27%

conﬁdence interval, the truncation errors of binding energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter

and pure neutron matter are consistent with the results given by a simple error analysis method

proposed by Epelbaum, et al. Finally, the reasonable values of the breakdown scale Λb in nuclear

matter are discussed through consistency checks of Bayesian method based on the calculations of

success rate.

INTRODUCTION

The chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory (ChEFT) as a perturbation method, achieves a great

success in investigating the properties of hadron systems, which partially solved the diﬃculty

of the non-nonperturbative of QCD theory at low-energy scale. Those physical quantities,

e. g., nucleon mass, pion decay constant, and low energy constants were calculated from

leading order to higher orders in ChEFT [1–3]. Furthermore, the nucleon-nucleon (NN)

potentials, which play a very important role in nuclear physics, can be also produced from

ChEFT, proposed by Weinberg ﬁrstly [4–6]. With the signiﬁcant progresses in last thirty

years [7, 8], the chiral potentials up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N4LO)

were worked out by several groups recently [9–13]. These NN potentials can provide very

high-precision theoretical descriptions to the thousands of NN scattering data. They have

been used to study the nuclear system from light nuclei [14] to inﬁnite nuclear matter [15].

Furthermore, the many-nucleon forces can be also obtained systematically in the uniﬁed

framework of ChEFT [16–20].

The pivotal technology in ChEFT is how to take the power counting for a dimensionless

parameter in the process of chiral expansion, which should ensure the higher-order contribu-

tions always smaller than the lower ones. The matrix elements of available chiral potentials

certainly satisfy such requirement [8]. However, the convergence of calculation results in the

complex nuclear systems generated by chiral potentials at diﬀerent expansion orders are not

so obvious due to the complication of few-body and many-body methods.

To estimate the truncation errors of the chiral expansion for the nuclear observables,

Epelbaum et al. developed an easily operational analysis methodology [9, 10].

It was

assumed that the observable can be expanded as a polynomial up to the highest chiral
expansion order, whose expansion parameter Q ∈ {p/Λb, mπ/Λb} is related to the typical
momentum scale p, pion mass mπ, and breakdown scale of the chiral expansion, Λb. Then,

the truncation errors are determined by the expansion coeﬃcient, which has the maximum

magnitude. In this way, truncation errors of many nuclear observables calculated by the

latest chiral potentials from Epelbaum et al.

(named as EKM potentials) [9, 10], such

as the proton-neutron total cross sections, the tensor analyzing powers in elastic nucleon-

deuteron scattering, the ground-state properties of light nuclei, and so on, were obtained and

demonstrated the valid convergence of the chiral expansion for diﬀerent order potentials [9,

2

10, 13, 14]. Recently, we also applied this scheme to investigate the truncation errors of basic

properties of nuclear matter [15], whose equations of state were calculated in the framework

of Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) method and with EKM potentials. The valid convergence

of chiral potentials for nuclear matter was aﬃrmed.

In the meantime, a Bayesian approach was introduced to discuss the truncation errors of

nuclear observable from ChEFT by Furnstahl et al. [21–23]. These formalism for truncation

errors were ﬁrstly proposed to investigate the quantities of perturbative QCD theory by

Carriari and Houdeau [24, 25]. This scheme was also applied to study the theoretical uncer-

tainties from the eﬀective ﬁled theory for nuclear vibration by P´erez and Papenbrock [26].

In such method, the truncation errors were seriously interpreted by statistical technology.

It can be derived from the degree-of-belief (DoB) interval, which is determined by the prior

probability distributions from the expansion coeﬃcients. Various NN scattering observables

were discussed in this framework [21, 23]. They found that the truncation errors of phase

shifts with EKM potentials for 1σ DoB intervals were consistent with those from the simple

analysis method proposed by Epelbaum et al. [9, 10]. The statistical consistency of the

chiral breakdown scale, Λb, was also explored.

In this work, we would like to extend this Bayesian method to analyze the truncation error

of equations of state of nuclear matter obtained by BHF method and EKM potentials for

diﬀerent DoB intervals and compare them with our previous results obtained by the simple

analysis method [15]. Furthermore, the reasonable breakdown scale in nuclear matter will

be discussed. This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we simply show the necessary

formula in Bayesian method for truncation error analysis. The results of this work are

presented and discussed in section III, while conclusions are given in section IV.

II. BAYESIAN TRUNCATION ERROR ANALYSIS METHOD

We followed the Bayesian scheme to treat the truncation errors given by Furnstahl et

al. [21, 23]. A nuclear observable X in ChEFT can be expanded as a polynomial with a

dimensionless parameter Q, which is relevant to the momentum and breakdown scale,

X = Xref

∞

Xn=0

cnQn,

3

(1)

where Xref is deﬁned as the natural size of X. It is usually taken the leading-order value

of X, i.e., X0. cn is a dimensionless expansion coeﬃcient and c1 = 0 due to the symmetry

requirement. In this work, we concentrate on the truncation errors of the equations of state

(EOSs) of nuclear matter. Therefore, the observable is the energy per particle of nuclear

matter, E/A, and the expansion parameter is regarded as Q = kF /Λb. kF is the Fermi

momentum of nucleon, which is determined by the nuclear density, ρB. Λb is the ChEFT

breakdown scale.

The error of observable truncating at the order k of the expansion is deﬁned as Xref∆k,

where the dimensionless function, ∆k is given as,

∆k =

∞

Xn=k+1

cnQn.

(2)

In practice, this summation for n should be stopped at some h + k + 1 order and the
higher-order terms will be neglected. However, these coeﬃcients cn (n ≥ k + 1) cannot be
obtained from the relevant nuclear many-body method, which should be extracted by the
known expansion coeﬃcients, cn (n ≤ k).
In Bayesian model, a probability distribution
function (pdf) for ∆k is deﬁned as prh(∆|ck), which is determined by a vector composed
of the lower-order coeﬃcients, ck. Here, h means that only h higher-terms are included in

the truncation error. The c0 and c1 are excluded in vector ck, since c0 is dependent on the

natural size of X and c1 = 0 due to the symmetry requirement in ChEFT,

This pdf decides the degree-of-belief (DoB), p, with the highest posterior density (HPD),

ck ∈ {c2, c3,

. . . , ck}.

where the (100×p)% is the probability for the true value of the nuclear observable X staying

k at the (k + 1) order (NkLO) prediction.

With a Bayesian network, Furnstahl et al derived ∆k in terms of the expansion coeﬃcients

by assuming them as random variables, which own a shared distribution with a speciﬁc size
or upper bound ¯c at central region. The pdf function, prh(∆|ck), generated by Bayesian
theorem, ﬁnally can be written as

prh(∆|ck) = R ∞

(5)

The choices of priors pr(cn|¯c) and pr(¯c) are very important to determine ∆k. Here, we take,

pr(cn|¯c) =
pr(¯c) =

θ(¯c − |cn|),

A log-normal distribution is used with a hyperparameter δ and is normalized for ¯c in (0, ∞),
which was demonstrated to be consistent with other choices as shown in Refs. [21, 23] for

NN scattering. Therefore, in this work, we concentrate to discuss the truncation errors of
nuclear matter with these choices. Furthermore, the prior prh(∆|¯c) can be worked out with
the properties of step function,

prh(∆|¯c) =

With these equations, the DoB interval, d(p)

can be solved numerically in Eq. (4) as an

inversion problem.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The binding energy per nucleon of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and pure neutron

matter (PNM) has been calculated order-by-order in the framework of Brueckner-Hartree-

Fock (BHF) method with the latest chiral NN potential regularized by a coordinate semilo-

cal form factor [15]. In BHF model, the three-body force is very important to obtain the

reasonable saturation properties.

In this discussion, the analysis of truncation error for

chiral potentials in nuclear matter is based on the two-body forces, which should generate

the dominant contribution to the binding energies of nuclear many-body systems, while the

three-body force is expected to provide the smaller contribution in the nuclear problem at

low energy scale. Actually, the description accuracy of nuclear few-body system with ab

initio methods will be largely improved with three-body force [9, 10].

In the present BHF model, the Brueckner two-hole-line expansion is used. Recently,

three-hole-line contribution of Goldstone diagrams was worked out, whose magnitude is less

than 8% of the one from two-hole-line expansion [27]. Therefore, the higher-order many-body

contributions from BHF method provide very few eﬀects in the truncation error analysis for

chiral potentials in nuclear matter.

5

Firstly, the expansion coeﬃcients cn from NLO to N4LO in Eq. (1) for the binding energy

per nucleon are extracted. Here, the chiral potentials are adopted with cutoﬀ R = 1.0 fm in

the semilocal form factor. The equations of state generated by another cutoﬀ potentials have

the similar behaviors. Actually, the breakdown scale Λb is a very important quantity, which

determines the magnitude of the dimensionless parameter Q and the expansion coeﬃcients,

cn. In this work, we ﬁrstly follow the choice by EKM as Λb = 600 MeV generated from

the analysis of NN scattering data [10]. In the last part of this section, it will be discussed

whether this value is suitable for the nuclear matter system.

Here, the equations of state are calculated up to ρB = 0.4 fm−3. The corresponding Fermi

momentum is about 350 MeV for SNM, which is not so large, comparing to the conventional

breakdown scale, Λb = 600 MeV. Therefore, the chiral expansion is validated up to such

density. On the other hand, the contribution of three-body force will increase rapidly with

density. However, at each chiral expansion order, their magnitudes are similar, which were

shown in recent work by Sammarruca et al [28]. Therefore, the contributions of many-body

interactions can reach the convergence order by order.

The extracted coeﬃcients (c2, c3, c4, c5) are shown as functions of nucleon density in

Fig. 1. In SNM case, the magnitude of c2 is less than one, smaller than other order expansion

coeﬃcients. This is because that the binding energies per nucleon with LO and NLO chiral

potentials did not have much diﬀerences. While, c4 at low density are quite small due to the

more repulsive components provided by N3LO chiral potential compared with those from
N2LO. In PNM, all of these coeﬃcient are located in the region [−2, 2]. The magnitude of
c3 are smallest now. These curves of coeﬃcients become ﬂat at high density.

Once the expansion coeﬃcients are obtained, the pdfs, pr(cn|¯c), pr(¯c),

· · · , can be worked
out naturally with Eq. (6). In the calculation of prior, prh(∆|¯c), the multiplication terms
should be interrupted at some order. In this work, we take h = 10, since the results are

converged quickly in the present numerical methods. Furthermore, the hyperparameter, δ

in prior pr(¯c) is taken as 1 following the Ref. [21]. For a given DoB, p, like the standard
conﬁdence level, 1σ or 2σ , the integration interval, d(p)
k
the truncation errors at k + 1 order of the binding energy is deﬁned as ±(cid:0) E

In Fig. 2, the EOSs of SNM with truncation errors are shown order by order. The original

standard deviation, i. e., p = 68.27%, while the light ones corresponding to 2σ standard

deviation, where p = 95.45%. Generally speaking, a higher DoB brings a larger uncertainty,

which means the truncation errors with 1σ standard deviation is smaller than those with

2σ. Therefore, the dark band should be included in the light band.

The truncation errors of binding energy per nucleon of SNM at NLO are very small,

especially for the 1σ case. As we shown before, the relevant expansion coeﬃcients, c2, are

quite small since the diﬀerences between the EOSs from the LO and NLO are slight. From

N2LO to N4LO, the truncation errors decrease systematically order by order at each density.

In the same chiral expansion order, they become larger with density increasing since the Q

value calculated by using the Fermi momentum becomes larger. This behaviors is natural

since a larger Q value will produce a worse expansion convergence from the perturbative
point of view. The empirical saturation properties of nuclear matter (ρ = 0.16 ± 0.01 fm−3
and E/A = −16 ± 1 MeV) are still not satisﬁed after considering the Bayesian truncation
errors only with two-body chiral potentials. However, it can be found that the saturation

densities become smaller derived from the upper limit of error band comparing with those

obtained by BHF method directly and are more closed to the empirical values.

Furthermore, it is noticed that the truncation errors with 68.27% DoB given by Bayesian

method are consistent with our previous results by a simpler analysis method in EKM

scheme except those at NLO [15]. In the EKM method, the errors of observables at NLO

are estimated not only by the shifts from NLO to LO but also by LO itself. Therefore, the

EKM uncertainty at NLO is much larger than those worked by Bayesian method. In the

other orders, the truncations errors of NN scattering observables from EKM scheme and

Bayesian method also have the similar behaviors shown by Furnstahl et al.

shown in Fig. 3. In the PNM, the nucleon density is given by ρB = k3

The analogous calculations are done for the PNM. Their EOSs with uncertainties are
F /3π2. Therefore, with
a same density, the dimensionless parameter, Q in PNM is larger than that in SNM. As a

result, the truncation errors of PNM are also larger comparing with the ones of SNM. The

band of N2LO for 68.27% credibility in PNM is relatively narrow, which is also related to

the small magnitude of c3 given in Fig. 1. In general, the uncertainty of binding energy per

nucleon of PNM decreases order by order.

The eﬃcacy of truncation errors analysis in this work can be examined with the Bayesian

model checking. Consistency checks will be done to investigate whether the DoB intervals

have been reasonably displayed as estimated. When the truncation errors from our cal-
culations are reasonable, a ﬁxed DoB interval d(p)

k , at some order should include the next
order contribution of the binding energy per nucleon at the same time. We will follow the

procedure of consistency checked proposed by Furnstahl et al. [23]. Construct a set of data

(N data), including the binding energies per nucleon of SNM or PNM from NLO to N3LO,

k , d(p)

In this scheme, the consistency of breakdown scale Λb can be checked and its reasonable

value also can be determined. In idea case, where each data in the set is uncorrelated, the

success rate should satisfy a binomial distribution. Hence, the posterior of successes with

total number N, and the given p is,

pr(n|p, N) =

N!

n!(N − n)!

pn(1 − p)N −n.

(8)

For a continuous n, this posterior corresponds to a β distribution. The conﬁdence intervals on

n for a given value of DoB p can be calculated with the highest posterior density prescription.

In this work, we chose the 1σ and 2σ conﬁdence intervals as ideal results.

The observable X can be expanded by including a scaling factor λ as

(9)

With this equation, the consistency checks at diﬀerent λ can be done and we can explore a

more reasonable breakdown scale Λb for nuclear matter.

In Fig. 4, the consistency checks for the binding energy per nucleon of PNM as an

example, are displayed. The success rate of the binding energy per nucleon of PNM within
NLO, N2LO, and N3LO chiral potentials at densities ρ = 0.05, 0.10,· · · , 0.40 fm3 are
calculated with the procedure mentioned before. There are N = 24 points in this set. λ = 1

corresponds to the original breakdown scale Λb = 600 MeV. The λ value is taken from 0.9

to 1.2 in this work. The ideal success rates with 1σ and 2σ conﬁdence intervals are plotted

as gray band and light gray band, respectively.

At λ = 0.9, i.e. Λb = 540 MeV, the success rates are higher than the limit of ideal case

when DoB is larger than 50%. With the λ increasing, the success rates are gradually closed to

the region of ideal case. The curves with λ = 1.1 and λ = 1.2 fall in the band representing

2σ conﬁdence interval completely, which means the breakdown scale, Λb should choose a

more reasonable value such as 660 MeV or 720 MeV in the investigation of truncation error

of PNM.

The similar consistency checks for SNM are also done. It is found that the success rates

of SNM with λ = 0.8 are located to the idea case, which means that the breakdown scale,

10

Λb = 480 MeV is preferred in SNM. This is because that the expansion parameter, Q in

SNM is smaller than that in PNM for a ﬁxed baryon density.

IV. CONCLUSION

The Bayesian analysis method were applied to study the truncation errors in equations

of state of nuclear matter generated by chiral nucleon-nucleon potentials in the framework

of Brueckner-Hartree-Fock model. The binding energy per nucleon of nuclear matter was

assumed to be expanded as a polynomial of dimensionless parameter, Q, which is depen-

dent on the Fermi momenta and breakdown scale. The truncation errors from the chiral

expansion were considered as the higher-order expansion contributions. The Bayes theorem

can provide an eﬃcient scheme to obtain the information of unknown expansion coeﬃcients

from the known ones. With this scheme, the truncation errors of binding energy per nucleon

of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter were obtained with 1σ and 2σ conﬁ-

dence intervals at diﬀerent chiral expansion orders. These truncation errors became smaller

with expansion order increasing in general, which were consistent with our previous results

within a simple analysis method. These calculations demonstrated that there are very good

convergences for the chiral potentials in nuclear matter. Finally, the consistency checks were

done to promise the reasonable analysis with success rates for diﬀerent breakdown scales.

They were compared to the ideal case. A larger breakdown scale in nuclear matter may

be more reasonable comparing to the value from nucleon-nucleon scattering. More analysis

calculations with diﬀerent prior, posterior pdfs and chiral potentials will be carefully done

in future. The Bayesian method provide a good chance for us to check the convergence of

observables in nuclear physics worked by chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory.
